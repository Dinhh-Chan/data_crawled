Inaccuracies within patient records can arise from manual entry errors, outdated information or differences in coding standards. Addressing and rectifying these discrepancies is essential to maintaining the integrity and accuracy of patient data, and ensuring that healthcare providers have access to reliable and timely information for clinical decision-making.\nInteroperability: Healthcare providers may use different EHR software that may not communicate or share data seamlessly. This can lead to disruptions in patient care.\nCost: Implementing EHRs requires substantial financial investment, including acquiring the EHR software, updating hardware, training, and ongoing maintenance. These fees affect smaller practices in particular.\nTraining and support: Transitioning to an EHR system requires healthcare providers and staff to acquire new skills and adapt to unfamiliar technologies. Comprehensive training, as well as post-implementation support, is essential to ensure that personnel are proficient in using EHRs.\nTransitioning to EHRs\nProviders eager to transition to electronic health records can overcome these challenges in a number of ways. First of all, by planning ahead. After a thorough assessment of an organization’s unique needs, workflows and goals, providers can get to the task of selecting the right EHR system. Evaluating different vendors based on factors such as functionality, usability, interoperability and scalability is the first step on that journey.\nOnce a system has been selected, a detailed implementation plan outlining timelines, milestones and requirements will help ensure a smooth rollout. In parallel, it’s also important to consider factors such as budget, staff training, data migration and potential workflow changes. Planning ahead empowers providers to anticipate challenges and mitigate risks, setting the stage for a smooth transition process.\nWith those two hurdles overcome, it is important to communicate the upcoming changes to staff – the sooner, the better. It is especially important to collect feedback on usability and their experience along the transition process so that any pain points can be addressed early on. Investing in staff training will increase user confidence, minimize resistance to change, and ensure that the new system benefits both patients and practitioners.\nFinally, it is paramount to communicate with the most important stakeholders of all: the patients. Open and transparent communication is essential throughout the transition to EHRs. Educating patients about the benefits of electronic health records, and addressing any concerns they may have about EHR privacy, security, or changes in the healthcare experience will build trust, reduce anxiety and promote engagement in the use of EHRs.Using standards for a smooth transition\nThe successful implementation, testing and adoption of EHRs requires collaboration between healthcare professionals, patients and policymakers. International Standards can make this collaboration easier. One such standard, ISO 13606, was developed by a group of international experts to facilitate the secure and seamless exchange of health information between multiple EHR systems or between a system and a centralized data repository. These standards can promote interoperability, streamline data exchange, and uphold the confidentiality and integrity of patient health information.\n\nISO 13606-1:2019Electronic health record communication — Part 1: Reference model\n\nISO 13131:2021Telehealth services — Quality planning guidelinesThe future of healthcare\nThe shift to EHR systems is more than a digital upgrade – it’s a healthcare revolution. These powerful tools are reshaping patient care, streamlining processes, and opening doors to medical breakthroughs we’ve only dreamed of. As EHR systems evolve, they’re not just changing how we store health information; they’re transforming how we heal and thrive. Welcome to the future of healthcare, where every bit of data brings us closer to a healthier world for all."

Very simply put, the neurons found in neural networks AI are simple mathematical functions that process the information that comes in (through the edge of networks, like synapses) and output a numerical value (depending on whether the neuron was activated).\nIn AI, neurons are pieces of software which work together to process and analyse complex data. Each neuron receives input from the previous layer, applies a mathematical function to that input and passes the result to the next layer. The choice and tuning of these mathematical functions are the main challenges to designing a neural network since all of its performance relies on having the correct setup for the desired output. This is done through an automatic process called training.Sign up for email updates\nStay updated on artificial intelligence and related standards!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Subscribe\n\n\n\nAlmost done! \nYou are only one step away from joining the ISO subscriber list.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nWhat are neural networks used for?\nOnce just a concept, neural networks are now revolutionizing a whole range of industries. Their versatility and power have led to a wide range of practical applications that are transforming the way we use and interact with technology. For example, they can analyse large amounts of financial data and make predictions about stock market trends, creditworthiness and fraud detection. This has the potential to greatly improve investment strategies and risk management.\nIn the healthcare industry, neural networks are used in disease diagnosis, drug discovery and personalized medicine. Health professionals can use artificial neural networks to help analyse medical images, patient records and genomic data to identify patterns and make predictions, leading to more accurate diagnoses and tailored treatment plans. Neural networks can also contribute to faster drug development by enabling the analysis of large-scale datasets.\nAnother talked-about application of neural networks is in self-driving vehicles – specifically with regards to object detection, navigation and real-time decision making – but also in the realm of user experience.\nAcross the service industry, chatbots powered by AI benefit greatly from neural networks which power entity recognition, natural language processing and sentiment analysis. Recommendation engines – such as those which suggest the next binge-worthy show we might like to watch – rely on pattern recognition and prediction capabilities.\nHow do neural networks work?\nWhat makes neural networks particularly fascinating is that they are inspired by the biological brain. They consist of a few key components:\n\nNeurons are the fundamental units of simulated neural networks. They receive input signals, process them using activation functions and produce output signals. These artificial neurons are interconnected in layers to form a network. The first layer, called the input layer, receives the initial data, while the last layer, known as the output layer, produces the end result. By taking inputs from the previous layer and passing outputs to the next layer, each neuron enables information flow throughout the network. There can be one or more hidden layers in the network, where calculations take place.\nWeights are the connections between neurons. They determine the strength of the signal being passed from one neuron to another. The weights are adjusted during the training phase of the neural network, allowing the model to learn and improve its performance.\nActivation functions introduce non-linearity into neural networks and help them model more complex relationships in data. They determine whether a neuron should be activated or not based on its inputs. These functions play a crucial role in shaping the behaviour and learning capabilities of neural networks.\n\nThe interplay between these key elements is what defines an artificial neural network.\nFeedforward, or forward propagation, is the backbone of how neural networks work, enabling them to make predictions and generate outputs. At its core, forward propagation is a simple yet powerful process. It involves passing the input data through the layers of interconnected neurons, with each neuron applying the activation function to its weighted sum of inputs.\nBackpropagation is often equally important. This is the process by which a neural network adjusts its weights in response to feedback received during training. It works by propagating the error from the output layer back through the network, allowing each neuron to adjust its weights accordingly. By iteratively adjusting the weights based on the feedback, the network can gradually improve its accuracy in making predictions and generating desired outputs.\nUnderstanding the different types of neural networks\nThere are various types of neural network models, each designed to excel in specific tasks, such as image recognition, natural language processing or time series analysis. Let’s look at the main types of artificial neural networks:\n\nFeedforward neural networks (FNNs)  are a type of artificial neural network where the information flows only in one direction, from the input layer to the output layer. They are commonly used for tasks such as pattern recognition, classification and regression.\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs)  are mostly feedforward networks designed to process grid-like data such as images or videos. The use of a convolutional neural network in deep learning relies on the application of filters to local regions of the input data, allowing it to automatically learn hierarchical representations of visual features. CNNs have become instrumental in image classification, object detection and computer vision tasks.\nRecurrent neural networks (RNNs)  are designed to process sequential data by having feedback connections. This allows them to retain information about previous inputs and use it to make predictions or decisions. RNNs are widely used in tasks like language modelling, speech recognition and machine translation.\nResidual neural networks (ResNet)  are a special kind of feedforward that allows the network to “skip” over certain layers, especially if they do not contribute to a better result. They are widely used, for example, in semantic segmentation tasks. ResNet are a simple yet effective technique to successfully train very deep neural networks.\n\nBeyond these few examples, there exist more varieties of neural network models which have a multitude of applications such as generating synthetic data, data visualization and feature extraction and simulation. Radial basis function neural networks, for example, are often used for function approximation and classification tasks, particularly in cases where the relationships between inputs and outputs are complex or non-linear. Or a graph neural network could be useful when analysing data held in graphs.\nHow are neural networks trained?\nTraining a feedforward neural network involves adjusting the weights associated with each connection between neurons. This requires datasets to serve as examples for the network to learn patterns, correlations and make accurate predictions. The quality and diversity of training data play a vital role in the network’s ability to generalize and perform well on unseen data.\nIt is worth noting that training a neural network model has inherent constraints:\n\nData requirements: Training a neural network requires large amounts of labelled data, which may not always be readily available.\nInterpretability: Neural networks are often referred to as “black boxes” because of the high dimensionality (data complexity) in which their computations take place, making it challenging to interpret the reasoning behind their decisions.\nComputational resources: Training neural networks AI can be computationally intensive, requiring significant initial computational resources and time. Further resources during deployment are also needed.\nOverfitting and underfitting: Neural networks can be prone to “overfitting”, where they become too specific to the training data and may not generalize well to new, unseen data. Conversely, when a model fails to capture important distinctions and patterns in the data, leading to poor performance even on training data, this is called “underfitting”.\n\nPros and cons of neural networks\nRegardless of the architecture of neural networks, their ability to learn patterns, adapt to change, perform multiple actions simultaneously and process vast amounts of unorganized data makes them a real game-changer. The main benefits of neural networks are:\n\nHigher accuracy: Neural networks can detect complex patterns that may not be apparent to human analysts or rule-based systems.\nAdaptability: Neural networks can adapt to changing patterns by continuously learning from new data.\nScalability: Neural networks can handle large volumes of data efficiently, making them ideally suited to real-time processing.\n\nBut while neural networks are undoubtedly powerful tools that have transformed various industries, like any technology, they come with their own challenges and limitations. Understanding these challenges is essential for maximizing their potential.\nFirst, neural networks require datasets to learn and make accurate predictions. The quality and representativeness of the data are crucial for the network’s performance. Acquiring and preparing these datasets can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.\nSecond, designing and optimizing neural networks requires expertise and computational power. Choosing the right architecture, adjusting hyperparameters and training the model can be a complex and iterative process. This complexity can make it difficult even for experts to implement and apply neural networks effectively.\nNeural networks also face limitations in terms of interpretability. Because of their complexity, it can be challenging to understand and explain the decision-making process of a neural network. This lack of interpretability raises concerns in critical applications, such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and accountability are essential.\nTowards robust AI networks\nAssessing the robustness of neural networks is crucial to ensuring that AI systems can maintain the same high level of performance under any conditions. Neural network systems pose specific challenges as they are both hard to explain and prone to unexpected behaviour due to their non-linear nature. This calls for alternative approaches, including International Standards.\nThe ISO/IEC 24029 series takes a holistic approach by addressing both ethical concerns and emerging technology requirements to enable the responsible adoption of neural networks. It consists so far of a general overview and a methodology for the use of formal methods to assess robustness properties of neural networks. This important series, still under development, will serve as the foundation for establishing global trust in AI systems worldwide.\n\nISO/IEC TR 24029-1:2021Robustness of neural networks — Part 1: Overview\n\nISO/IEC 24029-2:2023Robustness of neural networks — Part 2: Methodology for the use of formal methodsAre neural networks the future of artificial intelligence?\nWhile advances in neural networks can provide endless opportunities for creative problem-solving, the technology must be developed with responsible, thoughtful and forward-facing guardrails. Like any artificial intelligence, neural networks must advance along the lines of ethical and responsible thinking so that they can support human progress with minimal risk.\nInternational Standards can help researchers, regulators, users and other stakeholders align on what is needed, how to track progress, and best practices. Although the benefits we are already seeing – from our hospitals to our home comforts – are clear, it is vital that we make sure considerations of safety, privacy and transparency are built into the development of this technology. Only with a common language, shared metrics and a unified vision can we maximize the potential of neural networks for the greater good."

In essence, it allows computers to understand humans – and speak like them. If developed correctly, it could bridge the gap between people and machines, thereby opening a whole new realm of possibilities.\nNLP is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that applies machine learning and other technologies to text or speech. The research was founded on Alan Turing’s ideas and John Searle’s experiments in the 1950s. Most people will only have come into contact with it when personal computing became more widespread and Microsoft’s “Clippy” asked you if you wanted to write a letter or the red squiggly line suggested you may have spelled a word wrong.\nFast-forward a couple of decades and NLP is now a rapidly growing field that combines computer science, artificial intelligence (AI) and linguistics to analyse and understand human language (NLP AI).\nHere, we open up the dense world of natural language processing in AI in order to break down the basics, look at some of the tools and techniques behind it and explore some of the myriad uses for it today, giving you a solid foundation to build your understanding and help you answer the question: what is NLP?",
        "content": "What is natural language processing?NLP focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves the ability of a computer system to analyse, interpret and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. NLP utilizes various machine learning tools, techniques and algorithms, as well as symbolic AI, to enable machines to comprehend and process natural language data, including text and speech.By employing statistical models, machine learning and linguistic rules, NLP enables computers to perform tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, machine translation, chatbot development, and more.Sign up for email updates\nStay updated on artificial intelligence and related standards!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Subscribe\n\n\n\nAlmost done! \nYou are only one step away from joining the ISO subscriber list.

If you can't find the email, kindly check your spam folder and/or the promotions tab (if you use Gmail).\n\n\nHow your data will be used\nPlease see ISO privacy notice. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nHow does natural language processing work?\nThere are multiple steps along a machine learning pipeline that enable common NLP tasks. These components of NLP work together to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of human language by machines.\nFirst is data preparation, pre-processing, reduction, indexing and encoding. The data in this case is text, which could come from a website, multiple websites or other sources. This step involves:\n\nData cleaning – for example, writing a Python script to extract the text from the html of a website\nTokenization – breaking text down into smaller units such as individual words, known as tokens. This is why you read or hear about tokens in the context of Generative AI Large Language Models (LLMs)\nPart-of-speech tagging – the process of identifying word categories, such as nouns, verbs and adjectives\n\nOnce the data has been pre-processed, a machine learning algorithm can be developed to train NLP models. This requires feeding the software with large data samples to increase the accuracy.\nIt can then be used to complete tasks that break down text or speech that computer programs can more easily understand, including syntax (the arrangement of words), semantics (meaning of words and sentences), pragmatics (contextual meaning) and discourse (how sentences connect in text).\nNatural language processing tools\nSo what are some of the key tools and technologies used in NLP? Let’s look at some NLP examples.\nOne commonly used tool for NLP is the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), an open-source module built using the popular Python programming language. Thankfully, you don’t need to be an expert coder to do natural language processing with Python. Tools such as NLTK contain libraries of datasets and tutorials and provide pre-built functions and models that can be incorporated into common NLP tasks and subtasks, such as tokenization and semantic reasoning, which is the ability to reach logical conclusions based on facts extracted from text.\nWhat is natural language processing used for?\nNLP is now being used in a wide variety of everyday applications and is finding use in industries such as healthcare and finance. Here are some of the most common NLP applications and where you may have encountered natural language processing in AI:\n\nChatbots and virtual assistants: AI-powered applications, such as Siri and Alexa, use NLP techniques to interact with users through natural language conversations.\nLanguage translation: NLP models can be trained on vast amounts of bilingual data, enabling them to accurately translate text while considering grammar rules and contextual nuances.\nSearch engines: Question answering systems, such as search engines, utilize NLP algorithms to understand questions posed by users and provide relevant answers. These systems analyse the question’s context, identify key information, search for relevant documents or knowledge bases, and extract precise answers to satisfy user queries.\nEmail filtering: Many people will recognize the pain of an inbox with a huge amount of unread emails. NLP is used to filter emails into different categories. Top-of-the-line spam detection technologies use NLP’s text classification capabilities to scan emails for language that indicates spam or phishing.\n\nNLP has also become an indispensable tool in various industries, revolutionizing the way we interact with technology:\n\nHealthcare: NLP is crucial in the healthcare industry as it allows for efficient analysis of medical records, patient data and clinical notes. This helps improve diagnoses, identify patterns, predict outcomes and enhance overall patient care.\nFinance: NLP plays a significant role in the finance industry by automating manual tasks like analysing financial reports, news articles and customer feedback.

It also helps in sentiment analysis of customer reviews to understand their opinions about products or services.\nLegal: NLP aids legal professionals by automating tasks like contract analysis and legal document review, saving time and effort.\nEducation: NLP is beneficial in education as it enables intelligent tutoring systems that personalize learning experiences for students.\nHuman resources: NLP helps human resource departments with tasks like resumé screening, candidate matching and sentiment analysis in employee feedback.\n\nChallenges and limitations of natural language processing\nAs with any complex field, NLP comes with its fair share of challenges. The computational complexity of NLP tasks can be a significant limitation, for instance. Processing large amounts of text data requires substantial computer power and time, making it challenging to achieve real-time or near-real-time analysis. Improving the efficiency and speed of NLP algorithms is another ongoing challenge. However, challenges like these and the ones listed below also present exciting opportunities for innovation and growth.\n\nLimited contextual understanding and memory: NLP models often struggle to interpret or retain the meaning of words or phrases based on the context in which they are used. This can lead to misinterpretations or incorrect analysis of text data.\nAmbiguity and polysemy: Many words and phrases have multiple meanings, making it difficult for NLP models to accurately determine the intended use in a given context. This can result in inaccurate analysis or miscommunication.\nLanguage variations and idioms: The vast diversity of languages and their regional variations – with different dialects, idioms, slang and colloquialisms – make it challenging for NLP models to analyse and interpret text accurately across different linguistic contexts. Researchers are working to continuously update models and adapt to evolving language.\nLack of common-sense reasoning: While humans can infer implicit information from text using their general knowledge and common sense, NLP models often lack this capability. This hinders their ability to comprehend nuanced texts or make accurate predictions based on implied information.\nData quality and bias: The quality of data used for training NLP models plays a crucial role in their performance. Biased or incomplete datasets can lead to biased results, reinforcing existing societal biases or stereotypes.\nEthical and privacy concerns: With the increasing use of NLP in various applications, ethical and privacy concerns have emerged. Issues such as data privacy, security and potential misuse of NLP technology raise important questions regarding responsible development and deployment of NLP systems.\n\nTaming an unruly beast\nAs NLP models become integral to critical sectors like healthcare, finance and transportation, ensuring their safety, reliability and ethical use will be essential. International Standards offer a framework for consistency and quality across multiple uses, including diverse NLP applications. The creation of standards dedicated to AI, such as those developed by the group of experts in ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42, highlights ISO’s commitment to ensuring that AI technologies are developed and used responsibly and effectively.\n\nISO/IEC 42001:2023AI management systems\n\nISO/IEC 23894:2023AI — Guidance on risk managementAs part of its expanded AI work programme, a joint effort is underway on natural language processing systems in collaboration with ISO/TC 37, the expert committee on language and terminology. This initiative benefits from a diverse range of AI expertise, covering both spoken and written language and involving a variety of stakeholders from around the world. The expansion of ISO’s programme of work reflects the importance of International Standards as a solution to enable responsible adoption.\nThe future of natural language processing\nNLP stands on the brink of redefining digital communication, enhancing our ability to communicate not only with computers but with each other. Its future promises further integration with other AI fields, enhancing its capabilities. For example, the rise of neural networks in NLP is changing the way search works. Where results used to be served up from a database, neural networks now search for and serve the most relevant results to you based on your history of interaction. This will become even more accurate over time.\nHowever, addressing legitimate concerns is crucial to ensure that this technology benefits humanity. If we can do this, through rigorous standards that are established and enforced, then NLP can help foster a future where AI and human intelligence work in harmony for collective advancement."

Here, we will take a closer look at the importance of such systems in providing effective AI risk assessments and treatments.",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence explained\nAI is a technology that makes machines and computer programs smart, enabling them to do tasks that typically require human intelligence. It includes things like understanding human language, recognizing patterns, learning from experience and making decisions. In general, AI systems work by processing vast amounts of data, looking for patterns by which to model their own decision making.\nWhile this depiction of AI might resonate with the lay person, it is not entirely accurate. According to ISO/IEC TR 24030:2021, AI refers to the “capability to acquire, process, create and apply knowledge, held in the form of a model, to conduct one or more given tasks”. This definition is more accurate from the technological perspective and is not limited to fields where AI is already being used, but allows space for further development.About AI management systems\nSo how does AI work? An AI system works on the basis of input, including predefined rules and data, which can be provided by humans or machines, to perform specific tasks. In other words, the machine receives input from the environment, then computes and infers an output by processing the input through one or more models and underlying algorithms.\nAs the capabilities of AI grow exponentially, there are deep concerns about privacy, bias, inequality, safety and security. Looking at how AI risk impacts users is crucial to ensuring the responsible and sustainable deployment of these technologies. More than ever, businesses today need a framework to guide them on their AI journey. ISO/IEC 42001, the world’s first AI management system standard, meets that need. \nISO/IEC 42001 is a globally recognized standard that provides guidelines for the governance and management of AI technologies. It offers a systematic approach to addressing the challenges associated with AI implementation in a recognized management system framework covering areas such as ethics, accountability, transparency and data privacy. Designed to oversee the various aspects of artificial intelligence, it provides an integrated approach to managing AI projects, from risk assessment to effective treatment of these risks. \nSign up for email updates\nStay updated on artificial intelligence and related standards!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Subscribe\n\n\n\nAlmost done! \nYou are only one step away from joining the ISO subscriber list.

All of these contribute to the ethical and responsible use of AI for people the world over. Robust cycle of continuous improvement\nAs a management system standard, ISO/IEC 42001 is built around a “Plan-Do-Check-Act” process of establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving artificial intelligence. This approach is important for many reasons: \n\nFirstly, it ensures that AI’s value for growth is recognized and the correct level of oversight is in place. \nSecondly, the management system enables the organization to proactively adapt its approach in line with the technology’s exponential development.\nFinally, it encourages organizations to conduct AI risk assessments and define AI risk treatment activities at regular intervals.\n\nWith the rapid uptake of AI worldwide, ISO/IEC 42001 is predicted to become an integral part of an organization’s success, following in the footsteps of other management systems standards such as ISO 9001 for quality, ISO 14001 for environment and ISO/IEC 27001 for IT security. Unlocking the potential of AI\nIt’s clear that AI will continue to improve and advance over time. As it does, AI management will need to adapt to these changes, focusing on the different ways it can maintain and accelerate AI systems for the business world. We find ourselves at a crossroads where a measured approach is needed. How do we harness the full potential of AI opportunities without falling prey to the risks? \nWalking the tightrope between opportunity and risk is only possible with a robust governance in place. This is why it’s important for business and industry leaders to educate themselves on ISO/IEC 42001 – an AI management system that lays the foundation for an ethical, safe and forward-thinking use of AI across its various applications.

There is a growing need to proactively drive fair, responsible, ethical AI decisions and comply with current laws and regulations.\nUnderstanding the concerns of AI is the starting point for creating an ethical framework to guide its development and use. Any organization wishing to ensure their use of AI isn’t harmful should openly share this decision with as diverse a range of stakeholders as it can reasonably reach, along with consumers, clients, suppliers and any others who may be tangentially involved and affected.\nDeveloping and applying AI along the principles of AI ethics requires transparency in decision-making processes and the development of actionable policies of AI ethics. With considered research, widespread consultation and analysis of ethical impact, coupled with ongoing checks and balances, we can ensure that AI technology is developed and deployed responsibly, in the interests of everyone, regardless of gender, race, faith, demographic, location or net worth.What are the principles of responsible AI?\nConfronting ethical concerns means engaging with their ramifications with foresight and commitment. It’s vital to view AI’s ethical dimension not as an obstacle but as a conduit to lasting and sustainable tech progress. That’s why embedding responsible AI principles is essential to its evolution in a direction that benefits all.\nWhile there isn’t a fixed, universally agreed-upon set of principles for AI ethics, several guidelines emerge. Some key principles of AI ethics are:\n\nFairness: Datasets used for training the AI system must be given careful consideration to avoid discrimination.\nTransparency: AI systems should be designed in a way that allows users to understand how the algorithms work.\nNon-maleficence: AI systems should avoid harming individuals, society or the environment.\nAccountability: Developers, organizations and policymakers must ensure AI is developed and used responsibly.\nPrivacy: AI must protect people’s personal data, which involves developing mechanisms for individuals to control how their data is collected and used.\nRobustness: AI systems should be secure – that is, resilient to errors, adversarial attacks and unexpected inputs.\nInclusiveness: Engaging with diverse perspectives helps identify potential ethical concerns of AI and ensures a collective effort to address them.\n\n \n\n\n\nPromoting responsible AI practices\nThese principles should help to steer considered and responsible decision making around AI. In order to transition from theory to practice, organizations must create actionable policies of AI ethics. Such policies are crucial in weaving ethical considerations throughout the AI life cycle, ensuring integrity from inception to real-world application.\nWhile organizations may choose different routes to embed responsible AI practices into their operations, there are a few AI best practices that can help implement these principles at every stage of development and deployment.\nWhen deciding how to establish AI ethics, companies should:\n\nFoster collaboration across all disciplines, engaging experts from policy, technology, ethics and social advocacy to ensure multifaceted perspectives\nPrioritize ongoing education on AI best practices at all levels to maintain awareness and adaptability\nImplement AI ethics throughout the technology’s design, building them into AI solutions from the ground up\nEstablish clear oversight mechanisms, such as ethics committees or review Boards, to monitor compliance and guide ethical decision making\nProtect end-user privacy and sensitive data through strong AI governance and data usage policies\nEncourage transparency in AI processes, enabling accountability and trust from stakeholders and the public\nKeeping up with AI best practice\nTo keep your AI system trustworthy, it’s important to focus on three key areas: feeding it good, diverse data; ensuring algorithms can handle that diversity; and testing the resulting software for any mislabelling or poor correlations.\nHere’s how to achieve this:\n\nDesign for humans by using a diverse set of users and use-case scenarios, and incorporating this feedback before and throughout the project’s development.\nUse multiple metrics to assess training and monitoring, including user surveys, overall system performance indicators, and false positive and negative rates sliced across different subgroups.\nProbe the raw data for mistakes (e.g. missing values, incorrect labels, sampling), training skews (e.g. data collection methods or inherent social biases) and redundancies – all crucial for ensuring responsible AI principles of fairness, equity and accuracy in AI systems.\nUnderstand the limitations of your model to mitigate bias, improve generalization and ensure reliable performance in real-world scenarios; and communicate these to users where possible.\nContinually test your model against responsible AI principles to ensure it takes real-world performance and user feedback into account, and consider both short- and long-term solutions to the issues.\nResponsible AI: examples of success\nBy integrating responsible AI best practices and principles, we can ensure we end up with generative AI models that ultimately enrich our lives while keeping humans in charge. As we steadily transition towards a more responsible use of AI, numerous companies have already succeeded in creating AI-powered products that are safe and secure.\nLet’s take a look at some responsible AI examples:\n\nThe Fair Isaac Score, by analytics software firm FICO, is a credit scoring system that uses AI algorithms to assess creditworthiness. FICO maintains responsible AI practices by regularly auditing its scoring models for bias and disparities based on mathematics instead of subjective human judgement.\nHealthcare startup PathAI develops AI-powered diagnostics solutions to aid pathologists in diagnosing diseases. To ensure the safe and responsible use of AI in its software, the company validates the accuracy and reliability of its algorithms through rigorous clinical testing and peer-reviewed studies.\nWith its people-first approach, IBM’s Watsonx Orchestrate is revolutionizing talent acquisition. This AI solution for HR and recruitment promotes fairness and inclusivity in the hiring process by generating diverse pools of candidates, using fair assessment criteria, and prompting managers to incorporate diverse perspectives in the interview process.\nAda Health provides users with personalized medical assessments and advice. The AI-powered chatbot safely handles the diagnosis and screening of common conditions like diabetic retinopathy and breast cancer. AI best practices are ensured through transparent disclosure that users are interacting with an AI chatbot.\nUsing a constellation of satellites, Planet Labs is pioneering the use of AI in satellite imagery, transforming how we monitor the environment, analyse climate patterns and assess agricultural yields. By collaborating with environmental organizations and policymakers, the company ensures AI best practices are embedded in its model.\nThe standards approach\nAs we advance towards responsible AI, every corner of society needs to engage and be engaged. ISO, in collaboration with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), is keeping pace with this pursuit, crafting International Standards that safeguard and propel the principled application of AI technology.\nIn shaping ethical AI, the world’s governments, organizations and companies need to embody these values, ensuring that their pursuit of innovation is accompanied by ethical responsibility. International Standards will help to establish a high watermark of ethics in AI, consistently guiding the best practice in this transformative industry.\nA commitment to responsible AI is not a one-time act, but a sustained effort involving vigilance and adaptation. However, organizations should be aware that this commitment not only guides AI to align with common welfare, it also opens doors to its vast potential.\n\nISO/IEC 42001:2023AI management systemsReaping the rewards\nThere is every reason to be optimistic about a future in which responsible AI enhances human life. It is already making game-changing strides in healthcare, education and data analytics. It has the capacity to supercharge human resilience and ingenuity at a time when we – and the planet – need it most. Rooted in ethical design, it can offer us a symbiosis of technological innovation and core human principles, culminating in an inclusive, flourishing and sustainable global community.\nResponsible AI represents a comprehensive vision to mirror society’s ethical fabric within machine intelligence. It signifies a pledge to forge AI systems that uphold human rights, privacy and data protection. Through this lens, every AI initiative undertaken becomes a stepping stone towards a future where technology not only empowers, but also respects and enhances, the human condition."

        "content": "What is AI? Decoding the AI meaning\nArtificial intelligence is “a technical and scientific field devoted to the engineered system that generates outputs such as content, forecasts, recommendations or decisions for a given set of human-defined objectives” [ISO/IEC 22989:2022]. While this definition of artificial intelligence is accurate from the technical perspective, how does it translate for the average person?\nIn truth, AI is just a practical tool, not a panacea. It’s only as good as the algorithms and machine learning techniques that guide its actions. AI can get really good at performing a specific task, but it takes tonnes of data and repetition. It simply learns to analyse large amounts of data, recognize patterns, and make predictions or decisions based on that data, continuously improving its performance over time.\nToday, this AI meaning has evolved beyond mere data processing to include the development of machines capable of learning, reasoning and problem-solving. The machine learning has become so “competent” as to generate everything from software code to images, articles, videos and music. This is the next level of AI, the so-called generative AI, which differs from traditional AI in its capabilities and application. While traditional AI systems are primarily used to analyse data and make predictions, generative AI goes a step further by creating new data similar to its training data.\nSign up for email updates\nStay updated on artificial intelligence and related standards!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Subscribe\n\n\n\nAlmost done! \nYou are only one step away from joining the ISO subscriber list.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nHow does AI work?\nIn essence, AI analyses data to extract patterns and make predictions. It does this by combining large datasets with intelligent AI algorithms – or sets of rules – that allow the software to learn from patterns in the data. The way the system accomplishes this is through a neural network – an array of interconnected nodes that relay information between various layers to find connections and derive meaning from data.\nTo grasp how this works, we must unpack the following concepts:\n\nLearning: AI’s machine learning feature enables machines to learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions without explicit programming. Going one step further, advancements in deep learning empower AI software to understand more complex patterns using millions of data points.\nReasoning: The ability to reason is crucial to AI because it allows computers to mimic the human brain. AI can make inferences based on commands it is given, or other available information, to form hypotheses or develop strategies for addressing a problem.\nProblem solving: AI’s problem-solving capability is based on the manipulation of data through trial-and-error techniques. It involves using algorithms to explore various possible paths to find the most optimal solution to complex problems.\nProcessing language: AI uses natural language processing – or NLP – to analyse human language data in a way that is meaningful to computers. What is NLP? It refers to the ability of computers to understand, interpret and generate human language, using text analysis, sentiment analysis and machine translation.\nPerception: AI scans the environment through sense captors such as temperature sensors and cameras. Known as computer vision, this field of AI enables machines to interpret and understand visual data and is used in image recognition, facial recognition and object detection.\nStrong AI vs weak AI\nArtificial intelligence (AI) encompasses a diverse spectrum of capabilities, which can be broadly classified into two categories: weak AI and strong AI. Weak AI, often referred to as artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) or narrow AI, embodies systems meticulously crafted to excel at specific tasks within well-defined parameters. These systems operate within a confined scope of expertise and lack the capacity for general intelligence. Think of them as specialists trained to perform particular functions efficiently.\nDespite its name, weak AI is anything but weak; it is the powerhouse behind many of the artificial intelligence applications we interact with every day. We see examples of narrow AI all around us. From Siri and Alexa’s lightning-fast responses to IBM Watson’s data-crunching prowess and the seamless navigation of self-driving cars, ANI fuels the remarkable innovations shaping our world.\nHere are some other examples of narrow AI applications, characterized by their specialized algorithms designed for specific tasks:\n\nSmart assistants: Often referred to as the best examples of weak AI, digital voice assistants use natural language processing for a range of specific tasks like setting alarms, answering questions and controlling smart home devices.\nChatbots: If you’ve ever talked on a chat with your favourite e-store, chances are you’re communicating with AI. Many customer service platforms us ANI algorithms to answer common enquiries, leaving humans free to perform higher-level tasks.\nRecommendation engines: Ever wondered how Netflix always seems to know what movie you want to watch or how Amazon predicts your next purchase? These platforms use ANI to analyse your viewing or purchasing habits, alongside those of similar users, to deliver personalized suggestions.\nNavigation apps: How do you get from A to B without getting lost? A navigation app, such as Google Maps, is a software application that uses ANI designed to provide real-time directions to users when navigating from one location to another.\nEmail spam filters: A computer uses artificial narrow intelligence to learn which messages are likely to be spam, and then redirects them from the inbox to the spam folder.\nAutocorrect features: When your iPhone rectifies your typos as you write, you’re experiencing the power of weak AI at work in your everyday life. By leveraging algorithms and user data, these predictive text functions ensure smoother and more efficient text composition across devices.\n\nEach of these applications demonstrates the strength of ANI to execute well-defined tasks by analysing large datasets and following specialized algorithms. So, next time you marvel at the capabilities of AI, remember that it’s weak AI that powers these remarkable innovations, shaping our world in ways that we once thought unimaginable.\n\n\n\n\n\nStrong AI\n\nAlso know as artificial general intelligence (AGI)\nDesign to adapt, learn and apply knowledge across various domains\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeak AI\n\nAlso know as artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) or narrow AI\nDesign to excel at specific tasks within well-defined parameters\n\nIn contrast, the concept of strong AI, also known as general AI, aspires to develop systems capable of tackling a wide array of tasks with a level of proficiency that satisfies human standards. Unlike their narrow AI counterparts, strong AI systems aim to possess a form of general intelligence, allowing them to adapt, learn and apply knowledge across various domains. Essentially, the goal is to create artificial entities endowed with cognitive abilities akin to those of humans, capable of engaging in intellectual endeavours spanning diverse fields.\nWhile strong AI is purely speculative with no practical examples in use today, that doesn’t mean AI researchers aren’t busy exploring its potential developments. Notably, strong AI is being harnessed in the field of artificial general intelligence (AGI) research and the development of intelligent machines and social media algorithms.\nTheoretically, AGI could perform any human job, from cleaning to coding. So, although there are currently no real-life applications of AGI, the concept is poised to have a transformative impact in several fields. These include:\n\nLanguage: Writing essays, poems, and engaging in conversations.\nHealthcare: Medical imaging, drug research and surgery.\nTransportation: Fully automated cars, trains and planes.\nArts and entertainment: Creating music, visual art and films.\nDomestic robots: Cooking, cleaning and childcare.\nManufacturing: Supply chain management, stocktaking and consumer services.\nEngineering: Programming, building and architecture.\nSecurity: Detecting fraud, preventing security breaches and improving public safety.\n\nWhile researchers and developers continuously strive to push the boundaries of AI AGI capabilities, achieving true general intelligence comparable to human cognition poses immense challenges and remains an elusive goal on the horizon. That being said, with the significant advancements in AI technology and machine learning, it seems the question we should ask is not if but when.What are the four types of AI?\nArtificial intelligence (AI) encompasses a wide range of capabilities, each serving distinct functions and purposes. Understanding the four types of AI sheds some light on the evolving landscape of machine intelligence:\n\nReactive machines: These AI systems operate within predefined rules but lack the capacity to learn from new data or experiences. For instance, chatbots used to interact with online customers often rely on reactive machine intelligence to generate responses based on programmed algorithms. While they perform well within their designated functions, they cannot adapt or evolve beyond their initial programming.\nLimited memory: Unlike reactive machines, AI systems with limited memory possess the ability to learn from historical data and past experiences. By processing information from previous interactions, these types of AI systems can make informed decisions and adapt to some extent based on their training. Examples include self-driving cars equipped with sensors and machine learning algorithms that enable them to navigate through dynamic environments safely. Natural language processing applications also use historical data to enhance language comprehension and interpretation over time.\nTheory of mind: This type of AI is still a pipe dream, but it describes the idea of an AI system that can perceive and understand human emotions, then use that information to predict future actions and make decisions on its own. Developing AI with a theory of mind could revolutionize a wide range of fields, including human-computer interactions and social robotics, by enabling more empathetic and intuitive machine behaviour.\nSelf-aware AI: This refers to the hypothetical scenario of an AI system that has self-awareness, or a sense of self. Self-aware AI possesses human-like consciousness and understands its own existence in the world, as well as the emotional state of others. So far, these types of AI are only found in the fantastical world of science fiction, popularized by iconic movies such as Blade Runner.\n\nThese four types of AI showcase the rich diversity of intelligence seen in artificial systems. As AI continues to progress, exploring the capabilities and limitations of each type will contribute to our understanding of machine intelligence and its impact on society.Machine learning vs deep learning\nCentral to these advancements are machine learning and deep learning, two subfields of AI that drive many of the innovations we see today. While related, each of these terms has its own distinct meaning.\n\nSupervised learning: The algorithm is trained on a labelled dataset where each example has an input and a corresponding output, learning from this labelled data to make predictions on new, unseen data.\nUnsupervised learning: Without any predefined labels or outputs, the algorithm learns to discover hidden structures or groupings within the data.\nReinforcement learning: Trained to interact with an environment and learn through trial and error, the agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties as it performs actions allowing it to learn and improve performance over time.\n\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning, focused on training artificial neural networks with multiple layers – inspired by the structure and function of the human brain – consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) that transmit signals.\nBy automatically extracting features from raw data through multiple layers of abstraction, these AI algorithms excel at image and speech recognition, natural language processing and many other fields. Deep learning can handle large-scale datasets with high-dimensional inputs, but requires a significant amount of computational power and extensive training due to their complexity.Examples of AI technology\nSo what can AI do? Most people are familiar with it through smart speakers and smartphone assistants like Siri and Alexa, but new AI technology constantly makes our lives easier and more efficient in many other ways.\nHere are some examples of AI technology and applications:\n\nHealthcare AI can process and analyse vast amounts of patient data to provide accurate predictions and recommend personalized treatment for better outcomes.\nBusiness and manufacturing benefits from automation in every field, from fraud detection, risk assessment and market trends analysis to AI-powered robots on production lines. AI systems can also predict equipment failures before they occur and detect anomalies in network traffic patterns, identifying cybersecurity threats. And in retail, AI offers inventory management, personalized shopping experiences, chatbots to assist customers and analysis of customer preferences, increasing sales through better targeted adverts.\nEducation AI includes intelligent tutoring systems which adapt to students’ needs, providing tailored feedback and guidance. AI also offers automated grading, content creation and virtual-reality simulations.\nTransportation AI optimizes traffic flow, predicts maintenance needs, and improves logistics in shipping companies, while in agriculture it can optimize crop yield and reduce resource wastage. Drone technology monitors soil conditions, identifies crop diseases and assesses irrigation requirements, and AI systems can recommend efficient pesticide usage and crop management.\nEntertainment: By analysing user preferences, AI can recommend movies, music or books. Virtual and augmented reality create immersive entertainment environments. Realistic CGI and “special effects” AI enhances the visual experience of movies and games.\nThe growth and impact of generative AI\nThese examples of artificial intelligence, culminating in the rise of large-scale language models like Chat GPT, mark just the beginning of a remarkable journey. This is the advent of generative AI – an exciting new frontier in artificial intelligence, focusing on the creation of new content rather than just analysing existing data. Unlike traditional AI systems that are primarily designed for classification or prediction tasks, generative models aim to develop novel outputs that mimic human creativity and imagination. This will enable machines to autonomously produce various types of content, including images, text, music and even entire virtual worlds.\nHowever, generative AI is not yet fully polished. Generative models, while powerful, have several downsides, including the potential for creating convincing misinformation (or deep fakes), perpetuating biases and raising concerns about copyright and job displacement. They also pose security threats, challenges in quality control and require substantial computational resources, leading to high costs and environmental impacts.\nThe truth is, generative AI is still in its learning phase, and initial setbacks in certain software should not overshadow the extraordinary potential of AI technology. Efforts are underway to address the challenges associated with generative models through advancements in detection technology and improvements in training data and algorithms. They also include enhanced security measures, heightened education and awareness, and more efficient use of computational resources.\nThis multifaceted approach should ensure a more responsible and beneficial use of generative AI, supported by guidelines and regulations.AI governance and regulations\nWith increasing integration across various industries, the importance of ensuring the quality and reliability of AI software cannot be overstated. Despite the risks involved, AI still suffers from a lack of regulation. This is where International Standards can help.\nStandards, such as those developed by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 on artificial intelligence, play a pivotal role in addressing the responsible development and use of AI technologies. They help to bridge the gaps in regulation, giving decision makers and policymakers the tools to establish consistent and auditable data and processes.\nThese standards can bring long-term value to a business, particularly in areas such as environmental reporting. Standards build credibility with stakeholders, ensuring the benefits of artificial intelligence outweigh the associated risks through aligning with existing regulations and governance tools.\n\nISO/IEC 42001:2023AI management systems\n\nISO/IEC 23894:2023AI — Guidance on risk management\n\nISO/IEC 23053:2022Framework for AI systems using machine learningHistory of artificial intelligence: who invented AI?\nAI has progressed in leaps and bounds, transforming many aspects of our world. But to truly appreciate its current capabilities, it’s important to understand its origins and evolution. So who created AI? To find out, let’s take a journey through the fascinating history of artificial intelligence.\nToday’s AI loosely stems from the 19th-century invention of Charles Babbage’s “difference engine” – the world’s first successful automatic calculator. British code-breaker Alan Turing, who was a key figure in the Allies’ intelligence arsenal during WWII, amongst other feats, can also be seen as a father figure of today’s iterations of AI. In 1950, he proposed the Turing Test, designed to assess a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour indistinguishable from that of a human.\nFrom that point onward, advancements in AI technology began to accelerate exponentially, spearheaded by such influential figures as John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Herbert Simon, Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, Yann LeCun, and many other. But it wasn’t all smooth sailing. While AI flourished in the early years, with computers’ capability to store more information, it soon hit a roadblock: computers simply couldn’t store enough information or process it fast enough. It wasn’t until the 1980s that AI experienced a renaissance, sparked by an expansion of the algorithm toolkit and an increase in funding.\nTo cut a long story short, here are some key events and milestones in the history of artificial intelligence:\n\n1950: Alan Turing publishes the paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”, in which he proposes the Turing Test as a way of assessing whether or not a computer counts as intelligent.\n1956: A small group of scientists gather for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, which is regarded as the birth of this field of research.\n1966-1974: This is conventionally known as the “First AI Winter”, a period marked by reduced funding and progress in AI research due to failure to live up to early hype and expectations.\n1997: Deep Blue, an IBM chess computer, defeats world champion Garry Kasparov in a highly publicized chess match, demonstrating the fabulous potential of AI systems. In the same year, speech recognition software, developed by Dragon Systems, was implemented on Windows.\n2011: In a televised Jeopardy! contest, IBM’s Watson Deep QA computer defeats two of the quiz shows’ all-time champions, showcasing the ability of AI systems to understand natural language.\n2012: The “deep learning” approach, inspired by the human brain, revolutionizes many AI applications, ushering in the current AI boom.\n2016: Developed by a Google subsidiary, the computer program AlphaGo captures the world’s attention when it defeats legendary Go player Lee Sedol. The ancient board game “Go” is one of the most complex ever created.\n2017 to date: Rapid advancements in computer vision, natural language processing, robotics and autonomous systems are driven by progress in deep learning and increased computational power.\n2023: The rise of large language models, such as GPT-3 and its successors, demonstrates the potential of AI systems to generate human-like text, answer questions and assist with a wide range of tasks.\n2024: New breakthroughs in multimodal AI allow systems to process and integrate various types of data (text, images, audio and video) for more comprehensive and intelligent solutions. AI-powered digital assistants are now capable of engaging in natural, contextual conversations as well as assisting with a wide variety of tasks.\n\nThe exponential growth of computing power and the Internet has brought with it the concept – and the reality – of machine learning, the development of AI algorithms that can learn without being programmed, by processing large datasets. This is known as “deep learning” which empowers computers to learn through experience. Over the past decade, AI has become integral to everyday life, influencing how we work, communicate and interact with technology.How will AI change our world?\nAs it becomes more sophisticated, we can expect to see artificial intelligence transform the way we work and live. In addition to the many applications outlined above, AI will play a crucial role in addressing global challenges and accelerating the search for solutions.\nBut the potential implications of AI are far-reaching and profound. As AI becomes more powerful and pervasive, we must ensure it is developed and used responsibly, addressing issues of bias, privacy and transparency. For this to be achieved, it is crucial to stay informed and be proactive in shaping its development, to build a future that is both beneficial and empowering for all."

        "abstract": "The human brain is made up of innumerable elements all working together to create consciousness, thought and our innate humanity. This unique and complex beauty would seem impossible to artificially replicate; however, deep learning is making strides towards a future in which computers can think and learn just as a human brain does.\nThis subset of artificial intelligence is widely seen as one of the most revolutionary and powerful technologies in recent years. Its extraordinary capabilities lie behind a host of everyday products and services as well as emerging technologies.\nBut what is deep learning? How does it work? And why is it considered to be the “magic” behind many cutting-edge advancements? Here, we unpack the world of deep learning and explain it in simple terms.",
        "content": "What is deep learning? \nOften abbreviated to DL, deep learning is a subset of machine learning and artificial intelligence: a technique of training computers to mimic the way neurons in the human brain process and learn information – it is quite literally an artificial neural network. \nWith deep learning, machines are taught to process data in a way that simulates the many layers of our brain, so they can now perform tasks that were once exclusive to human talents. We are already seeing numerous deep learning applications and uses for DL meaning things like image recognition, language translation, and even autonomous driving, are all within the realm of computer capabilities. In essence, deep learning is a powerful tool for unlocking complex insights hidden within vast amounts of data. \nBut what’s behind this fascinating technology? At the core of deep learning are artificial neural networks (ANNs), designed to emulate the complex network of neurons in the human brain. These networks begin with an input layer that gathers raw data – think images or text. As data flows through hidden layers, the ANN transforms it, extracting increasingly abstract features that help recognize intricate patterns. The output layer then delivers predictions, bridging the gap between data and actionable insights.\nDeep learning features diverse architectures, each tailored for specific tasks. Here are a few examples:\n\nConvolutional neural networks excel at image processing, skillfully identifying patterns in visual data.\nRecurrent neural networks are adept at handling sequential data, using memory elements to recall past inputs – ideal for language tasks.\nGenerative adversarial networks have two components – the generator and discriminator – that compete to produce incredibly realistic data, such as lifelike images from random noise.\n\nThis basic deep learning definition just hints at its complexity. To truly grasp the impact of deep learning, we need to look under the hood and see what’s driving this technology. It’s not just the data but the remarkable way these systems learn, adapt and improve with every bit of information they process. So, what’s really happening behind the scenes? Let’s break down how deep learning works and discover the mechanisms powering this paradigm shift.\nSign up for email updates\nStay updated on artificial intelligence and related standards!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Subscribe\n\n\n\nAlmost done! \nYou are only one step away from joining the ISO subscriber list.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nHow does deep learning work?\nThe natural human brain is made up of millions of interconnected neurons. Modelled on nature, deep learning algorithms use artificial neural networks made of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, called artificial neurons or units. Each layer processes information from the previous layer and passes it on to the next, gradually extracting higher-level features and patterns.\nDeep learning models are trained on large amounts of labelled data, known as training sets, to learn how to recognize and classify patterns. This might be a simple challenge like the “Dogs vs Cats” dataset – a standard computer vision dataset in which photos must be classified as either containing a dog or cat. More sophisticated datasets might include wine appreciation or how to spot fake news amid authentic reporting.\nDuring training, the parameters and weights of the neural network are adjusted to minimize the difference between predicted outputs and true outputs. Across multiple iterations, the model becomes increasingly finessed until it is capable of making predictions or performing tasks with a high degree of accuracy and precision.\nAssorted programming languages have emerged for implementing deep learning algorithms. Many are looking to use deep learning with Python for its simplicity, readability and extensive “libraries” (pre-written bundles of code which make it easier for developers to solve common problems). Popular libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch provide a rich set of tools and functionalities for building and training deep learning models.Deep learning vs machine learning\nDeep learning is an approach to creating rich hierarchical representations through the training of neural networks with many hidden layers. It is an evolution of machine learning and one that needs much less help from humans. While basic machine learning models do improve at performing their specified functions as they absorb new data, if they return an inaccurate prediction, an engineer must intervene and make adjustments. Deep learning, though, makes its own adjustments, course-correcting without the need for human assistance.\n\n\n\nDeep learning applications\nDeep learning is already positively impacting our lives as it is deployed across many different sectors. Its profound influence is not just reshaping technology; it is redefining the very way we experience life.\n\nComputer vision: From unlocking your phone with just a glance to helping doctors detect diseases early, deep learning is reshaping how machines “see” the world. In healthcare, it is revolutionizing medical image analysis, while in security and retail, it powers facial recognition and product identification.\nNatural language processing: Deep learning powers tools like Google Translate, bridging language gaps across the globe, and fuels voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, transforming your voice commands into actions. Behind the scenes, deep learning models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) craft human-like conversations and generate text for everything from chatbots to news articles.\nHealthcare: Deep learning is a silent force behind modern healthcare, identifying tumours in medical scans and predicting patient outcomes with uncanny accuracy. The result? Faster treatments, more personalized care and a future where medicine is tailored to the individual.\nAutonomous vehicles: Self-driving cars use deep learning algorithms to help detect objects and make real-time decisions. Whether it’s identifying a stop sign or navigating a crowded street, deep learning is steering us toward a future of safer roads and driverless transport.\nFinancial services: From spotting fraudulent transactions in real time to predicting stock market swings, AI is reshaping the financial world. Banks are using deep learning models to assess credit risk more accurately, helping lenders make faster, smarter decisions.\nRobotics: Robots on factory floors are becoming more autonomous, handling precise tasks like assembly and sorting with near-perfect accuracy.\nE-commerce and retail: Online platforms use deep learning algorithms to predict what you’ll buy next, offer tailored product suggestions, and even let you search with images instead of words. Retailers are also leveraging AI for inventory management, ensuring shelves are stocked and customers are never disappointed.\nEntertainment and media: What’s your next Netflix binge or Spotify playlist? Streaming services analyse your preferences to serve up exactly what you didn’t know you wanted.\nEnergy and utilities: In power plants and smart grids, deep learning is driving efficiency. By analysing sensor data, it predicts equipment failures before they happen, cutting downtime and reducing costs. Deep learning models help utilities anticipate demand and optimize power flow, ensuring a more reliable and sustainable energy supply.\nPersonalized marketing: Behind every banner ad or email offer, there’s an AI ensuring your message hits home. Advertisers can now craft highly targeted campaigns, analysing your preferences, browsing history and social media activity to deliver ads that resonate.\nWhat are the limitations of deep learning?\nDespite its remarkable capabilities and breathtaking potential, DL is not without its limitations and issues. It demands high memory and storage capacity and consumes data at such a rate that obtaining high-quality, diverse and well-labelled datasets can be challenging, especially in domains where data is scarce or expensive. It’s also hungry for training resources and power and can be susceptible to overfitting – performing well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data.\nIn common with most areas of AI, deep learning also presents ethical concerns around data security and the inherent human biases and inaccuracies which can pervade areas of its learning.Framework for deep learning\nAlthough the potential benefits of deep learning are enormous, good governance of the technology will be essential to help us realize them. The development of appropriate legal and ethical frameworks will be critical to build trust and mitigate risks.\nInternational Standards will have an important role to play in ensuring the responsible adoption of deep learning within the field of AI. ISO, in collaboration with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), has already published a number of standards through its dedicated group of experts on artificial intelligence, and is building an evolving framework of guidance for deep learning applications around the world.\nBusinesses and policymakers can already benefit from these standards as part of their assurance of ethical and safe deployment of deep learning models. Complying with International Standards builds trust between clients and contemporaries in all sectors.\n\nISO/IEC TR 24029-1:2021Robustness of neural networks — Part 1: Overview\n\nISO/IEC 24029-2:2023Robustness of neural networks — Part 2: Methodology for the use of formal methods\n\nISO/IEC 42001:2023AI management systemsThe future of deep learning\nDeep learning is still in its infancy, but it’s expected to grow exponentially and is likely to transform society. The integration of deep learning with other cutting-edge technologies – for example, combined with augmented reality or virtual reality – could revolutionize the way we experience and interact with the world around us. A simple walk down the street could be augmented by instant information about nearby buildings and landmarks. Virtual worlds will become increasingly immersive and realistic.\nWe can expect to see deep learning applied to fields such as agriculture, energy and manufacturing, where it has the potential to optimize processes, improve efficiency and drive innovation. And, more importantly, to accelerate solutions to planet-wide problems like climate change and food security.\nGuided by International Standards and driven by human creativity and ingenuity, the future landscape of deep learning is fascinating, inspiring and almost without limit."

        "content": "Understanding the basics: What is artificial intelligence?\nAt its core, AI refers to a machine or computer system’s ability to perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence. It involves programming systems to analyse data, learn from experiences, and make smart decisions – guided by human input. The most familiar form of AI is virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa, but there are many iterations of the technology.\nAI has the potential to revolutionize various industries by enabling machines to solve complex problems and think intuitively, going beyond mere automation. This encompasses various subfields and technologies, such as machine learning and natural language processing.\nUncover more with our in-depth guide on what is artificial intelligence.\n \nSign up for email updates\nStay updated on artificial intelligence and related standards!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Subscribe\n\n\n\nAlmost done! \nYou are only one step away from joining the ISO subscriber list.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nBuilding a responsible artificial intelligence\nWith an ability to synthesize, analyse and act on enormous amounts of data in seconds, artificial intelligence is extremely powerful. As with any powerful technology, it is crucial we implement it responsibly to maximize on its potential while minimizing negative impacts.\nFor example, if trained using unscrutinized data, AI can replicate harmful biases about race, religion, upbringing or other human characteristics. This could be potentially disastrous if embedded in artificial intelligence used in health, recruitment, law or other human-centred applications.\nAnother of the key ethical concerns surrounding AI is privacy. With AI systems collecting vast amounts of data from databases worldwide, there is a need to ensure that personal information is protected and used responsibly. For example, facial recognition technology, often used in security systems or social media platforms, raises questions about consent and potential misuse.\nEnsuring the responsible development of AI is crucial for its safe, trustworthy and ethical advancement. But how can transparency and explainability be addressed in the context of responsible AI? These concepts are discussed in detail in our article on building a responsible artificial intelligence.\nWhat is machine learning?\nAt its core, machine learning refers to the ability of a computer system to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. One example is spam filtering in emails. By detecting similar patterns in spam messages, email platforms can learn what messages are useful, and what should be kept out of the inbox.\nSo how does machine learning work? It starts with data. Lots of it. Machine learning algorithms are trained on huge datasets which they learn to analyse to identify patterns, relationships and trends. These patterns can then be used to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.\nThere are remarkable benefits and applications of machine learning in our daily lives. You can find everything you need to know from our article “What is machine learning?”.\nWhat is deep learning?\nDeep learning and machine learning are sometimes used interchangeably, but there is a difference.\nDeep learning is a type of machine learning. However, deep learning can analyse more types of information and perform more complex operations. The process behind deep learning is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain – specifically the way neurons are connected and work together to process information. This allows it to make more nuanced and in-depth predictions from data.\nFor example, in basic machine learning, a computer could learn to recognize birds in pictures. Trained on pictures of birds and other animals or objects, the machine learns to distinguish between them by being exposed to unique avian features such as wings and beaks.\nDeep learning takes this a step further. Staying with the bird example, deep learning might learn to recognize not just basic bird features, but also intricate details like feather patterns, making it more accurate in identifying birds and even able to separate eagles from pigeons.\nWant to dive deeper into deep learning and its applications? Get the lowdown on what is deep learning.\nWhat is natural language processing?\nNatural language processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand and interact with human language.\nNLP involves a wide range of technologies that allow computers to understand the structure and meaning of human language. It encompasses tasks like speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation.\nBy analysing and interpreting language, NLP enables computers to extract useful information, answer questions, and carry on conversations. For example, virtual assistants like Alexa can understand and provide information about the temperature outside, the news headlines or the average weight of an orca whale.\nWant to know more? Join us as we delve into what is natural language processing and its applications.\nWhat are neural networks and how do they work?\nImagine the human brain: a web of billions of neurons, receiving information from the external world, sending that information to other parts of the brain, synthesizing what it means based on past experiences, and communicating a reaction in response.\nArtificial neural networks are mathematical models that enable deep learning. At their core, they are an imitation of the human brain. Made up of layers of interconnected nodes – called artificial neurons or perceptrons – each artificial neuron takes in inputs, performs calculations and generates an output. These outputs are then passed on to the next layer of perceptrons, creating a hierarchical structure.\nThe power of neural networks lies in their ability to learn and recognize patterns in data. Intrigued about neural networks and how they are being used today? Read more in our article “What are neural networks?”.\nWhat is an AI management system?\nAn AI management system is like the brains behind how an organization handles its AI projects. It’s all about setting up rules and methods to make sure AI is used responsibly and effectively. This system helps manage everything from assessing risks to putting AI into action in a responsible way.\nThink of it as a roadmap for using AI wisely as the technology evolves. An AI management framework sets out a structured way for managing the risks and opportunities associated with AI. It covers key components such as transparency, explainability and autonomy, giving organizations clear directions on how to use AI in line with evolving regulations (e.g. EU AI Act).\nWith responsible management and oversight, AI can fulfil its potential as a hugely positive technological development.\nKeen to know more? Read the latest in our article “What is an AI management system?”.\nStandards and artificial intelligence\nISO’s mission is to establish globally recognized standards across various industries, and AI is no exception.\nInternational Standards for artificial intelligence provide a framework to guide the responsible and ethical use of AI technologies. These standards cover areas such as privacy, bias, transparency and accountability. By adhering to these standards, organizations can work to ensure that their AI systems are fair, transparent, and uphold ethical principles.\nOne example of International Standard in the AI field is ISO/IEC 23894, which focuses on the management of risk in AI systems. This standard aims to ensure that AI algorithms and models are understandable and can be audited for bias and fairness, thereby building trust and confidence in AI systems.\n \n\nISO/IEC 42001:2023AI management systems\n\nISO/IEC 23894:2023AI — Guidance on risk management\n\nISO/IEC 23053:2022Framework for AI systems using machine learningISO standards also address the interoperability and compatibility of AI systems, ensuring that AI technologies can work seamlessly together and exchange data effectively. This is especially important as AI becomes more integrated into various industries and applications.\nAs the development and adoption of AI continues to accelerate, developing rigorous standards will be key to ensuring artificial intelligence becomes a technology for good."

        "abstract": "Global awareness of climate change and sustainability has grown exponentially over the past decade, making terms like corporate responsibility, carbon footprint and transparency the new buzzwords of our time. The drive towards a more sustainable future has propelled ESG considerations – or environmental, social and governance in its full form – to the forefront of Board meetings in companies worldwide, firmly establishing their status as paramount concerns in the modern business world.\nCost savings, increased market share and stakeholder expectations are just some of the key drivers behind the shift towards sustainability. Simultaneously, governments at local and national levels are tightening environmental, fiscal and corporate legislation and regulations, requiring companies to disclose a significant amount of data through ESG reporting.\nThis means companies will need robust, auditable ESG data. ESG data reporting is often one of the primary challenges for companies across all industries, and one that can be solved easily by following International Standards and best practices. This article delves into the intricacies of ESG reporting and how ISO standards can help companies incorporate ESG into their corporate strategy.",
        "content": "What is ESG reporting?\nESG is a set of non-financial measures that contribute directly to an organization’s risk management profile, sustainability development and corporate social responsibility. More specifically, ESG reporting is a type of corporate disclosure that details the environmental, social and governance (ESG) promises, efforts and progress of an organization. Its purpose is to shed light on a company’s ESG activities to improve investor transparency. These activities include climate change, human rights and executive compensation.Why does ESG reporting matter?\nRunning a business responsibly, being climate-conscious and moving towards “net zero” has a direct impact on revenue, costs and market share. It can also strengthen a company’s reputation and create trusting and long-lasting relationships with stakeholders. But this relies on companies adopting tight corporate governance, operational transparency, and working within the boundaries of national and international legislation and regulations.\nESG reporting is important for many reasons that make it the corporate mainstay across industries and jurisdictions.\n\nTransparency: With growing concerns around sustainability and climate change, companies are increasingly asked to be transparent about their operations. ESG reporting gives companies the chance to report on their ESG efforts and progress.\nRisk management: ESG-related issues can expose a company to risk that can lead to disruptions and financial losses. ESG reporting is an opportunity to get ahead of those issues by disclosing activities and identifying potential risks.\nInvestor demand: Investors rely on all types of metrics to gauge a company’s performance and growth potential. Robust ESG practices and transparent reporting are more likely to attract investors, leading to increased capital inflow.\nBrand reputation: Consumers choose to do business with companies that align with their sustainability beliefs. They are likely to be more loyal to companies that report on their ESG activities and progress.\nCompliance: An ESG report is a way for companies to make proper disclosure and helps ensure regulatory compliance. As regulations continue to evolve, companies with a strong ESG reporting are better positioned to comply with these changes, avoiding penalties and legal complications.\nOperational efficiency: ESG reporting often involves a thorough review of operational processes. It can be the driver that pushes a company to enhance efficiency and identify areas of improvement.\nGoal tracking: ESG reporting is a way for companies to be accountable for their ESG performance claims. It provides a way to track progress on goals that play out over a longer period of time.\n\n\nSign up for email updates\nRegister for resources and updates on sustainability and environment related standards!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Subscribe\n\n\n\nAlmost done! \nYou are only one step away from joining the ISO subscriber list.

What does this mean? Is ESG reporting mandatory? Depending on where a company has its headquarters, there can be national or specific jurisdiction-level regulations for ESG reporting. There are also a growing number of regulations in specific industries calling for companies to report in some form on their ESG activities and impacts.\nThis has raised the bar on ESG reporting, with the emergence of new ESG reporting requirements in 2023. In the European Union, for example, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation came into effect in March 2021, providing requirements for ESG reporting with a focus on sustainability-related initiatives. This regulation is complemented by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which came into effect in January 2023. \nFor its part, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued its final climate rules, entitled “The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors,” that require certain public companies to make disclosures about their climate-related risks and greenhouse gas emissions.\nSo, although ESG reporting is not yet a requirement everywhere, there is an increasing trend towards regulation.So what should an ESG report contain?\nESG reporting plays a pivotal role in guiding investment and business decisions. Based on these disclosures, stakeholders can make more informed choices aligned with their values and long-term objectives.\nThese reports contain qualitative and quantitative information related to the following areas:\n\nThe environmental dimension includes anything that contributes to carbon emissions and climate change, such as energy, water and waste management; ventilation and air quality; materials sourcing; and supply chain management.\nThe social dimension addresses the relationships and reputation a company has with its stakeholders, such as employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, health and safety, human rights, and labour practices.\nThe governance dimension is the internal system of practices, controls and procedures that a company uses to govern itself, such as business model resilience, risk management, legal and regulatory compliance, due diligence, and meeting external stakeholders’ needs.\nAbout ISO’s ESG implementation principles\nISO can help strengthen even the most ambitious of ESG strategies. Through its extensive portfolio of standards, ISO can help those enterprises striving to keep one step ahead of legislative, regulatory and social change.\nISO is developing an International Workshop Agreement (IWA) for embedding ESG within the culture of an organization. This high-level international structure will help manage ESG performance, as well as measure and report within existing disclosure frameworks, to ensure consistency, comparability and reliability of ESG reporting and practices globally.\nISO’s ESG guidelines are intended to be complementary and interoperable with existing voluntary and regulatory reporting frameworks to facilitate global harmonization and alignment on ESG principles and approaches. It will provide guidance to users engaging with the ESG ecosystem to support compatibility with other ESG frameworks, including national and international legislation. ISO’s ESG implementation principles can be used by organizations, large and small, across all sectors and countries.\nISO/WS ESG Framework for implementing environment, social and governance (ESG) principlesIWA 48 Environment, social and governance principlesHow ESG reporting drives sustainable success\nCompanies need to become more collaborative in their efforts to reduce their carbon footprint, achieve net zero and become fully sustainable. This collaboration cannot be achieved through strategy alone, and ESG reporting is fast emerging as a core aspect of corporate responsibility.\nStrong policies require robust processes, impermeable risk frameworks, and operational streamlining and coordination, all of which can be seamlessly achieved through the adoption of ESG frameworks and ISO standards.\nBy bringing ISO into the conversation around ESG, business leaders can better plan their journey to a more sustainable and competitive future. And in building that future, a robust portfolio of ISO standards can help them clearly identify potential risks, corrective actions and possible opportunities."

        "published_day": "Not specified",
        "abstract": "Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing our world today. Rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, extreme weather events – the impacts are being felt across the globe and pose significant challenges to economic growth. Urgent action is needed to mitigate climate change and adapt to its effects.\nReversing the climate crisis requires massive global investments. The annual financial needs for mitigation and adaption measures are set to increase steadily to an average estimate of USD 9 trillion in 2030, eventually soaring to a staggering USD 10 trillion a year by 2050.* Currently available levels of climate finance are multiple times below the needed amounts. Developing countries, where the effects of climate change are most severely felt, find it particularly challenging to finance the necessary measures.\nClimate finance has been a central element of global climate change negotiations since 1992. The Cancun Climate Change Agreements of 2010 called on developed countries to jointly “mobilize” USD 100 billion annually by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. While this might seem a commendable goal, the world’s first-ever global stocktake at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP28) in December 2023 showed that both financial contributions and mitigation efforts are far from meeting commitments.\nThe more we wait, the higher the costs, both in terms of mitigating global temperature rise and coping with its impacts. So let’s examine what climate finance truly entails and explore financing solutions that can help address the climate crisis.\n* Source: Climate Policy Initiative",
        "content": "What is climate finance?\nDefining climate finance continues to be a topic of intense debate. According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), “Climate finance refers to local, national or transnational financing – drawn from public, private and alternative sources – that seeks to support mitigation and adaptation actions that will address climate change”.\nHow this plays out in real terms is slightly more complex. Climate finance is just one of many terms employed to describe the movement of funds in the context of climate-related matters. In general, though, a distinction can be made between “sustainable finance” that takes a broad environmental, social, economic and governance approach, and the narrower concept of “green finance”, concerned only with environmental issues. Even more narrowly focused are those actions targeting exclusively climate change mitigation and/or adaptation, which we call climate finance.\nIn all cases, though, total climate finance includes all financial flows whose expected effect is to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions and/or enhance resilience to the impacts of current and projected climate change.What are climate finance flows?\nClimate finance flows encompass the allocation and distribution of financial resources with a specific focus on supporting projects, programmes and activities related to climate change. These funds are directed toward initiatives that address both mitigation (reducing greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation (building resilience to climate impacts).\nHow does capital “flow” from one country to another? Flow diagrams shed some light on how countries are giving and receiving climate finance, but also on the types of finance offered by different donor countries. They reveal, for example, the proportion of funding allocated to adaptation versus mitigation projects, and whether financial support primarily comes in the form of grants or loans.What types of investment are needed?\nBroadly speaking, there are three key categories that receive climate financing, each supported by specialized climate finance solutions designed to mobilize and channel funds towards climate action.\n\nMitigation investments are directed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and include funding projects related to renewable energy sources.\nAdaptation investments focus on enhancing resilience to climate change impacts, for example by supporting infrastructure improvements that can withstand extreme weather events.\nDual-benefit investments serve both mitigation and adaptation objectives, such as sustainable agriculture initiatives that contribute to carbon sequestration while improving food security.\n\n\nSign up for email updates\nRegister for resources and updates on sustainability and environment related standards!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Subscribe\n\n\n\nAlmost done! \nYou are only one step away from joining the ISO subscriber list.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nWhat are the instruments of climate finance?\nClimate finance encompasses a variety of instruments. To meet the increasing demand for capital, innovative climate finance solutions have emerged to finance or refinance projects and assets that contribute to climate action. Some key financial instruments include:\n\nGrants and donations: Grants provide non-repayable funds to support climate-related projects and initiatives. They usually operate as a results-based financing where the disbursement of funds is tied to the successful delivery of specific outputs (e.g. infrastructure).\nDebt swaps: Debt-for-climate swaps are financial arrangements where debtor countries negotiate to restructure their existing debt in exchange for a commitment to invest the freed-up resources in climate change mitigation and adaptation projects within their own borders. This mechanism is especially beneficial for countries grappling with substantial debt burdens.\nEquity shares: Equity typically refers to ownership stakes or shares in companies or projects. Equity shares in climate-related activities allow investors to support initiatives aligned with climate goals while potentially earning returns based on the project’s success.\nGreen bonds: A green bond is a fixed-income instrument designed to support specific climate-related or environmentally friendly projects.\nGuarantees: A guarantee represents a commitment where the guarantor (for example a development finance institution or an export credit agency) pledges to fulfil the debtor’s obligations to the debt provider. Specifically in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation activities, guarantees play a pivotal role in unlocking private-sector funding by mitigating the perceived financial risks associated with climate initiatives.\nConcessional loans: These differ from traditional loans because they offer favourable terms: longer repayment periods or below-market interest rates. They are granted by major financial institutions, such as development banks and multilateral funds, to developing countries for high-impact projects to combat climate change and build a more sustainable future.\n\nThe choice of instrument, and the way it is delivered, can significantly influence whether the finance effectively achieves its mitigation and adaptation objectives. For this reason, establishing the appropriate mix of climate finance solutions for the country, sector and project is critical to maximizing the impact of climate finance.Measuring the effectiveness of climate finance\nAccurately measuring the efficacy of climate finance initiatives in channelling funds towards impactful projects remains a complex task. At its core, it involves tracking financial flows that are explicitly aimed at addressing climate change mitigation, adaptation and resilience efforts. This includes funding from various public and private sources, such as government budgets, international aid, private investments, and innovative financial instruments such as green bonds and carbon markets.\nChallenges persist in accurately capturing and categorizing climate finance flows. For example, distinguishing between climate-specific funding and general development assistance can be challenging, as many development projects contribute both to climate adaptation and mitigation. Additionally, tracking private-sector investments in climate-friendly projects can be tricky due to the lack of standardized reporting practices.\nHowever, measuring climate finance performance goes beyond tracking financial flows alone. Climate financiers want to be reassured with solid data that their engagement will not be perceived as “greenwashing”. For example, green bonds are typically issued to raise money for climate-friendly investments; yet the link between genuine climate-friendly measures and their impacts can sometimes be tenuous, for lack of transparency and adherence to standards.Climate finance safeguards\nRobust measurement frameworks are essential for tracking progress, ensuring accountability and guiding future investments. To address these challenges, efforts are underway to improve transparency, consistency and comparability in climate finance reporting. That’s why major financial institutions, including the World Bank, are embracing new technologies like blockchain to create more transparent, verifiable and scalable climate finance solutions.\nInternational Standards also play a significant role in attracting and managing climate finance. Not only do they ensure transparency, reliability and accountability in financial flows, but they help to measure, report and verify the environmental impact of investments related to climate change.\n\nISO 14097:2021Framework for assessing and reporting investments and financing activities related to climate change\n\nISO 14100:2022Guidance on environmental criteria to support green finance\n\nISO 14001:2015Environmental management systems\n\nISO 32210:2022Sustainability principles for organizations in the financial sectorHaving complete oversight of a project’s environmental impacts is key in determining whether it qualifies for climate finance. Completeness of information is a core principle of ISO 14100, a standard that helps organizations on both sides of the financial transaction determine the environmental risks and opportunities associated with potentially beneficial projects, assets and activities. By adhering to global standards, investors can ensure their funds are directed towards projects that genuinely contribute to climate change mitigation or adaptation.Where we are now…\nClimate finance solutions will remain a cross-cutting theme for the foreseeable future. While discussions often focus on financial support from affluent nations to developing countries, the transition toward sustainable finance presents significant obstacles for the world as a whole. The primary challenge lies in efficiently channelling funds to where they need to go.\nAt COP28, discussions continued on setting a “new collective quantified goal on climate finance” in 2024, taking into account the needs and priorities of developing countries. The new goal, starting from a baseline of USD 100 billion per year, will be a building block for the design and subsequent implementation of national climate plans that need to be delivered by 2025.\nAccording to the UNFCCC, the next two years will be critical. At COP29, governments must establish a new climate finance goal, reflecting the scale and urgency of the climate challenge. And at COP30, they must come prepared with new nationally determined contributions that are economy-wide, cover all greenhouse gases and are fully aligned with the 1.5 °C temperature limit."

        "abstract": "The quest to “master nature” to serve human needs has led to unintended and alarming consequences. News today is rife with startling reminders of how climate change is affecting people around the world, from wildfires and floods to the loss of biodiversity and even human lives. But what exactly is climate change?\nClimate change refers to the long-term transformation of Earth’s weather conditions. The phenomenon is caused by a number of natural and human-induced factors. Imagine the Earth as a giant greenhouse. Normally, the sun’s heat comes in and keeps things warm enough for us to live comfortably. But when we burn fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas for energy, we release extra gases into the air. These gases trap more heat, making our “greenhouse” warmer than it should be. This leads to glaciers melting, sea levels rising, and weather events like hurricanes and droughts becoming more extreme and frequent.\nThe growth and prosperity of businesses and organizations around the world should not come at the cost of the environment. While the challenge might seem overwhelming, there is a path to a sustainable future. Here, we explain some key terms related to climate change, such as greenhouse gases and net zero, and also uncover some of the tools organizations can adopt to address climate change and promote development in an integrated and balanced way.",
        "content": "What is the greenhouse effect?\nClimate change is largely caused by a process called the greenhouse effect. When the sun’s energy reaches the Earth, some of it is reflected back to space, while the rest is absorbed and re-radiated by greenhouse gases. These gases include water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and other gases naturally present in the atmosphere.\nThink of it as a blanket. Just as a blanket keeps you warm by trapping body heat, greenhouse gases keep the Earth warm by trapping heat from the sun. This heat helps to maintain the Earth’s average temperature, making it hospitable for life as we know it.\nIn recent years, however, human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have increased concentrations of these greenhouse gases. The result? An increase in global temperatures that is fundamentally altering the planet’s climate system.\nInterested in learning more? Read about the basics of the greenhouse effect.What is net zero?\nAs global temperatures continue to rise, the Earth’s natural equilibrium is disrupted. Unless we manage the vast amount of greenhouse gas emissions, we will not be able to avert the impending climate crisis. Achieving “net zero” refers to maintaining an overall balance between the greenhouse gases emitted and those removed from the atmosphere. This means that any emissions must be fully compensated, or offset, by the removal of an equivalent amount of CO2 over a given period of time.\nNet zero is our most potent weapon to combat the climate crisis. Embracing the shift towards net-zero emissions provides environmental benefits as well as economic, social and health advantages. That’s why many countries, companies and organizations are currently working towards ambitious net-zero targets as part of concerted international efforts to combat the catastrophic effects of climate change.\nIs net zero the same as carbon neutral? How do we reach the world’s net-zero targets? Find all the answers and more in our article “Embracing net zero: A crucial step towards a sustainable future”.Climate change solutions for a healthy future\nClimate change is already causing disruptions across all facets of life, including critical infrastructure like transport, communication networks, energy and water resources. Scientists anticipate that these changes will lead to more frequent disease outbreaks, increased mortality, and the displacement of populations, particularly affecting the world’s most vulnerable communities.\nWe urgently need innovative strategies to counteract the worst effects of climate change. Embracing nature-based solutions offers a holistic approach to combatting climate change while nurturing the planet’s natural resources for generations to come. Bringing nature into cities by planting trees, reintroducing species into the environment, and restoring coastal ecosystems to mitigate erosion are just a few examples. By leveraging the power of ecosystems such as forests, wetlands and grasslands, these natural climate solutions not only help sequester carbon dioxide but also enhance biodiversity, protect habitats and bolster resilience against extreme weather events.\nCurious to know more? Discover how nature-based climate change solutions can pave the way for a healthy future.What is climate finance?\nHumanity is taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. But our commitment to act is not enough – it must be backed by funding. Reversing climate change requires substantial economic resources. These are especially important to help less financially equipped countries meet their climate targets, pay for mitigation and adaptation, and mobilize more climate finance. Many developing countries, who often face the brunt of climate change, don’t have enough financial backing to work on sustainable strategies.\nIn 2015, at the 21st United Nations climate change conference (COP21), nearly all of the world’s countries committed to Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) – a climate action plan to cut emissions and adapt to climate impacts. It was decided that developed countries would provide financial resources to help developing countries adapt to climate change and phase out their emissions. This financial support is crucial for making the necessary changes to energy systems, infrastructure and industries these countries urgently need to decarbonize their economies and protect themselves from climate hazards.\nSo what is climate finance? Climate finance is funding at the local, national and transnational level that supports activities needed to combat climate change. These funds sponsor a wide range of initiatives, including both mitigation efforts (actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation strategies (measures to cope with the impacts of climate change). The goal is to secure funds from various sources, including public funds, private investments, international aid, and innovative financial instruments, to enable countries to transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient future.\nThis topic generates much debate: How much funding is needed? Where should it be spent?

Think of it as a journey we’re all on together, where every one of us has a role to play in making sure we keep our world healthy and thriving for years to come. Essentially, it emphasizes that growth and development should not compromise the health of our environment, and that it should be a continuous and inclusive process.\nTo help achieve this, the United Nations has outlined 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as part of a global agenda to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all by 2030. Climate action has been recognized as the most significant opportunity to advance the UN Goals and guide the global, regional and national development efforts of countries worldwide. Despite the challenges, many local governments have set more ambitious targets than their national counterparts, and an increasing number of cities are upping their commitment to delivering the SDGs by making positive, sustainable changes to combat the climate crisis at the local level.\nReady to dive deeper? Find out why climate action in cities is vital to sustainable development.What is ESG reporting and why does it matter?\nA concrete way to progress towards sustainability, and responsible business practices, is through ESG reporting. It is the process by which companies disclose information about their operations in relation to environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations. These reports typically detail a company’s initiatives related to reducing carbon emissions, promoting diversity and inclusion, ensuring ethical business practices, and addressing other sustainability concerns.\nESG reporting is a way for businesses to measure and communicate how their ESG initiatives stack up against industry benchmarks and targets. This type of reporting provides stakeholders, like investors and customers, with valuable insights that can influence decision-making and highlight potential opportunities and risks that might affect a company’s value.\nStill curious? Read more to find out why ESG reporting really matters.Basics of an environmental management system\nIn today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, sustainability is a strategic imperative. Enter the environmental management system (EMS), a powerful tool that revolutionizes how organizations navigate environmental challenges. An EMS is essentially a set of rules and tools that help a company keep track of and reduce the negative effects its activities might have on the environment – such as emissions, waste, resource consumption and biodiversity impacts.\nBut an EMS is more than just paperwork. It’s about fostering a culture of environmental stewardship within an organization. By establishing clear roles and responsibilities, promoting employee engagement and providing training on environmental best practice, an EMS empowers employees at all levels to contribute to sustainability efforts. It also helps companies stay compliant with environmental regulations and standards, reducing the risk of fines or legal issues while enhancing their reputation as responsible corporate citizens.\nISO 14001 is the gold standard for environmental management, helping organizations to be more environmentally responsible and fulfil their legal obligations. With benefits ranging from cost savings to enhanced public perception and reduced liabilities, this International Standard can help reshape the sustainability playbook for businesses worldwide.\nKeen to learn more? Brush up on the basics of an environmental management system.ISO standards and climate change\nAddressing climate change is a multifaceted challenge, and ISO standards can play a pivotal role in shaping the global response. Offering a comprehensive framework, they empower organizations to effectively measure, manage and report their environmental impacts, facilitating the transition to a more sustainable future.\n\nIWA 42:2022Net Zero Guidelines\n\nISO 14064-1:2018Greenhouse gases\n\nISO 14090:2019Adaptation to climate changeFrom ISO 14001 for environmental management to ISO 50001 for energy management, International Standards offer practical guidelines and best practices to tackle climate-related risks and promote sustainable development. By adhering to ISO standards, organizations can enhance their environmental performance, reduce carbon emissions and contribute to the global effort to combat climate change.\nThe adoption of ISO standards is a significant step towards sustainable business practices – in particular since all management system standards now incorporate climate change considerations. This reflects a collective commitment to a more sustainable and resilient world, where economic growth is balanced with environmental stewardship. Climate change is a challenge unprecedented in human history, and only by working together can we collectively ensure that the necessary action is taken for a sustainable future."

These Global Goals don’t just support economic growth but also promote social inclusiveness and environmental protection. Together, the three dimensions of sustainability (economy, society and environment) present a balanced pathway to prosperity, ensuring all people on this planet can lead happy, healthy and fulfilling lives.What are the Sustainable Development Goals?\nThe 17 Sustainable Development Goals were adopted by the United Nations Member States in 2015, with 169 targets to be met by 2030. These goals and targets are universal, meaning that they apply to all countries around the world. They aim to tackle global challenges including those related to poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace and justice, and are all interconnected.\nYet, according to the Sustainable Development Goals Report 2023, all of the SDGs are seriously off-track at the halfway point towards the 2030 deadline. This alarming statistic emphasizes the need to take a closer look at our current achievements and gaps.Climate and sustainable development\nThe research is clear: climate impacts on sustainable development are profound. Climate change is putting development achievements at risk, hitting vulnerable communities particularly hard. The risks associated with a given climate hazard depend on a country’s vulnerability and exposure. Escalating weather events are predicted to significantly increase ill health and premature deaths, as well as population exposure to heat-related morbidity and mortality.\nAt the same time, a country’s climate risks are determined by the development decisions it makes. For example, the global trend towards urbanization puts more people’s health at risk since the impacts of climate change may be aggravated in urban contexts. Air pollution in cities, to name but one, is a major health threat contributing to millions of premature deaths each year. If no action is taken, the consequences will continue to threaten urban safety, resilience and sustainability.Building sustainable cities\nThis poses a practical question: How does climate-resilient development differ from traditional development strategies? How does it impact cities in particular? Greater effort is needed to convert “adaptation thinking” into a journey of long-term planning that meets the challenges posed by climate change.\nIntegrating urban weather, climate, water and environmental services, as well as effective governance at the local level, is essential to helping cities achieve Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. These tailor-made weather services, combined with results-based city planning and infrastructure management, have the potential to improve cities’ climate resilience, with associated benefits for sustainable urban development, resulting in improved public health, safety and wellbeing for citizens.\n\nSign up for email updates\nRegister for resources and updates on sustainability and environment related standards!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Subscribe\n\n\n\nAlmost done! \nYou are only one step away from joining the ISO subscriber list.

These include:\n\nSolar power: Solar panels are one of the most efficient ways to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels. Highly adaptable, they can be installed on buildings of varying shapes and sizes and are more affordable than ever before.\nWind turbines: Wind is an abundant source of renewable energy – and it’s free! By harnessing wind power, cities worldwide have the potential to transform how they produce and consume energy in urban environments.\nGreen spaces: Cities can turn into “urban heat islands” during the summer months. Green spaces are great for cooling cities down and filtering air pollution, and are an essential feature of sustainable urban development.\nSustainable construction: Incorporating sustainable building practices in construction projects can significantly reduce their environmental impact. These include sustainable housing developments which utilize cleverly designed features, infrastructure and technology to minimize a building’s carbon footprint.\nEfficient water fixtures: Simple water-saving fixtures (e.g. low-flow taps, dual flush toilets and toilet stops) help conserve water used for essential services, and in so doing reduce operating costs and enhance sustainability.\nWhy sustainable cities are key\nThese are just a few examples of sustainable development that have the potential to foster positive global change. Focused on the social dimension of sustainability, these efforts prioritize the creation of livable urban areas that promote wellbeing by meeting people’s needs in their living and working environments.\nA true eco-city, then, is one that is designed to be self-sufficient and sustainable, with an emphasis on renewable energy sources, green transportation and natural habitats. Green spaces and supporting technology are embedded at the heart of the urban environment to reduce CO2 emissions, improve air quality and protect natural resources.What is a sustainable housing development?\nThe importance of housing is integral to sustainable urban development because of its reliance on natural resources. Sustainable housing, as enshrined in Goal 11 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, aims to ensure that everyone has access to adequate, safe and affordable homes by 2030. These smartly designed homes offer comfortable, healthy and secure living environments using sustainable housing techniques that lower the owner’s carbon footprint, cut energy costs and promote active lifestyles.\nSustainable housing development has four main advantages:\n\nMitigating climate change: Sustainable housing reduces carbon emissions by incorporating energy-efficient technology, renewable energy sources and sustainable construction materials.\nConserving resources: Sustainable housing developments prioritize recycled and locally sourced materials, reducing the strain on natural resources.\nReducing energy consumption: By incorporating energy-efficient features like solar panels, better insulation, smart technologies, and passive heating and cooling techniques, sustainable homes can optimize energy performance, leading to lower utility bills.\nEnhancing indoor air quality: Sustainable housing developments prioritize indoor air quality by using non-toxic building materials and promoting proper ventilation systems. This contributes to healthier living environments.\nStandards for sustainable living\nBuilding a sustainable city is a complex undertaking as each city has its own unique challenges. One common denominator can make the task much simpler – ISO standards. International Standards provide valuable guidance across all aspects of city life, from energy efficiency and intelligent transport, to air quality and waste management.\nCity leaders can effectively address the threat of climate change by incorporating standards into urban planning. Key standards such as ISO 50001 for energy management systems and ISO 52000 for managing the energy performance of buildings are instrumental in promoting sustainable housing practices. Sustainable urban development doesn’t just reduce the global carbon footprint, it also promotes better living conditions and lowers energy costs in cities and beyond.\n\nISO 50001:2018Energy management systems\n\nISO 52000-1:2017Energy performance of buildings — Part 1: General framework and proceduresCities of the future\nAmidst the urgent climate crisis, we need to reconcile two considerations: sustainability and uncertainty. The speed and complexity of current changes make it hard to tell which solutions will stand the test of time, and these doubts could easily prevent us from moving forward with necessary measures.\nYet within this landscape of unpredictability, the concept of sustainable urban development offers a tangible solution for a greener and more resilient world. While cities are particularly at risk from climate change, they also have the potential to drive powerful breakthroughs. Through integrated planning, community engagement and strategic investments, new urban development can forge a path towards resilient infrastructure, social cohesion and sustainable practices.\nLooking ahead, urban resilience will be crucial for cities grappling with the challenges of a changing climate. As global awareness for the planet continues to grow, renewed emphasis on sustainable living will redefine the very essence of urban development, shaping cities that prioritize harmony with nature and the wellbeing of their residents."

        "abstract": "You can’t avoid climate change, that much is certain. Its impacts are already being felt around the world in a variety of ways, from extreme weather events to threats to our water and food security. While some changes can be attributed to natural phenomena (volcanic eruptions, solar radiation, tectonic shifts…), human activity is mostly to blame for the increased frequency and severity of natural disasters. But severe weather conditions are not just becoming more frequent, they are also getting much harder to predict.\nA changing climate can, directly or indirectly, affect many aspects of society in potentially disruptive ways. Floods and droughts damage our agriculture, rising sea levels erode our coastlines, and intense storms destroy our homes and communities. In short, climate change is disrupting all areas of life, including essential services such as transportation, telecommunications, energy and water supplies. Over time, scientists expect an increase in disease outbreaks, loss of life and population displacement, especially among the world’s most vulnerable communities.\nReversing the process calls for swift, decisive action. Nature-based solutions are an important piece of the puzzle, both for carbon storage and building climate resilience. Using natural resources to address environmental and climate challenges has enormous potential to reduce the negative impacts, while preserving the planet and its people. Let’s take a closer look at how nature can help us tackle the climate crisis.",
        "content": "What are the solutions to climate change?\nCore to climate change solutions is reducing greenhouse gases. There are two ways to do this: we can stop adding them to the atmosphere, and we can support Earth’s ability to remove them from the atmosphere. This is called climate change mitigation, and its goal is to reduce emissions to a level that Earth can handle without further warming.\nWhile these actions are essential, they aren’t sufficient. Even if we stabilized greenhouse gas emissions today, scientists predict that the world would continue to warm to well beyond 2 °C above preindustrial levels. Anticipating and managing the negative effects of climate change is vital to help us cope with the impacts that are already happening, and those still expected to happen in the coming decades. This is called climate change adaptation and includes all the ways we can change – or adapt – to the effects of climate change so we can stay fed, healthy and safe.Embracing natural climate solutions\nFor climate action to be sustainable, healthy climate solutions must harness the power of nature itself. Combined with cutting fossil fuels, natural climate solutions offer immediate and cost-effective ways to tackle the climate crisis while supporting thriving ecosystems and resilient communities.\nNature-based solutions to climate change include a collection of strategies that have the potential to both reduce and remove greenhouse gas emissions. They do this by enhancing the capacity of ecosystems to absorb carbon dioxide or by restoring damaged habitats so that they no longer emit harmful greenhouse gas emissions. By harnessing nature’s ability to balance its ecological systems, natural climate solutions help protect, better manage and restore the environment, ensuring it can continue to provide essential ecosystems services.Three climate change actions that protect the planet\nProtect, manage, restore – that’s the basic formula. Taking action to regenerate the lands and ecosystems plays an important role in removing additional carbon from the atmosphere and improving soil health, water quality and biodiversity. It can also help avert the worst effects of climate change.\n\nProtection: Healthy ecosystems can serve as natural buffers against extreme events such as wildfires, flooding and drought. Examples include reefs and barrier islands that shield coastlines from storm surges, wetland ecosystems that absorb floodwaters, and “controlled” burning that clears excess forest debris, reducing the risk of more destructive wildfires.\nManagement: Effectively managing natural-based solutions can contribute to climate mitigation. For instance, improving the way forests are managed keeps the soils in good condition so that they can continue to perform as effective carbon sinks. In the same way, adapting farming practices to changing climate conditions, for example by growing more heat/drought-tolerant crops, helps support food resilience.\nRestoration: Restoring degraded habitats by bringing ecological diversity into the landscape helps reinforce nature’s ability to address climate change, and leads to greater ecosystem stability. We need to dedicate more land to nature. For example, planting trees in cities, reviving formerly forested land, and reverting natural flows to coastal wetlands and peatlands, will all contribute to increasing carbon sequestration.\n\nWhen conserved, restored and managed wisely, natural ecosystems reduce emissions by absorbing and storing large amounts of greenhouse gases. In addition to removing emissions from the atmosphere, these healthy climate solutions provide numerous benefits: cleaner air and water; flood and erosion control; increased biodiversity; and the ability to adapt to the impacts of climate change.\n\nSign up for email updates\nRegister for resources and updates on sustainability and environment related standards!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Subscribe\n\n\n\nAlmost done! \nYou are only one step away from joining the ISO subscriber list.

Many conservation programmes carried out in recent years spark hope for a brighter climate future. Covering all three aspects of natural climate solutions – protection, management and restoration – these projects work towards reviving ecosystems once threatened by overexploitation, land conversion and pollution.\nOne of the most inspirational is Africa’s “Great Green Wall” initiative that aims to grow an 8 000 km mosaic of trees, grasslands and vegetation across the entire width of the continent, transforming the lives of millions who live on the frontline of climate change. Its goal is to restore 100 million hectares of degraded land, sequester 250 million tonnes of carbon and create 10 million green jobs in the rural areas across the Sahel region by 2030.How do ISO standards support climate action solutions?\nISO is strongly committed to supporting climate protection efforts. International Standards have a key role to play in promoting the wider uptake of nature-based solutions to climate change in urban and rural areas. They do this by giving key players the tools to achieve a successful green transition, and supporting governments’ policy ambitions for a more sustainable, climate-neutral economy.\nWithin this context, ISO has been developing environmental standards across the board. These include the ISO 14000 suite of standards on environmental management systems, which details practical tools for organizations to manage the impact of their activities on the environment. Other examples include standards for “positive” sustainable agriculture, forestry, biodiversity, and other forms of nature-based solutions.\n\nISO 14001:2015Environmental management systems\n\nISO 14097:2021Framework for assessing and reporting investments and financing activities related to climate changeAccelerating the transition\nNature-based solutions are fast becoming a central component of local government strategies for environmental and climate action. Climate solutions that are inspired and supported by nature offer a holistic and cost-effective way to protect, manage and restore the environment, while delivering tangible benefits for society. Nature-based solutions can generate income for local communities and benefit municipalities that depend on these resources for the health and well-being of their residents.\nBringing natural climate solutions to scale will require a concerted effort – and some help from ISO standards. Climate change is a major and growing global threat to nature, biodiversity and people. However, nature also provides key solutions – if the global community takes steps to protect, restore and better manage its natural resources. All the solutions to bring climate change under control are at our fingertips; what we need now is a collective endeavour to implement them effectively."

        "abstract": "It’s easy to have mixed feelings about carbon. Is it good or bad? On the one hand, it’s the foundation for life on Earth. On the other, it’s linked to climate change. It’s the most commonly produced greenhouse gas and traps heat in the atmosphere. This is known as the greenhouse effect. It warms the planet to temperatures that keep life on Earth livable. Without it, the world would be more like Mars: a frozen, uninhabitable place.\nThe delicate balance of life on our planet hinges on a complex array of factors. From erupting volcanoes and wildfires, to deforestation and fossil fuels, the carbon cycle is affected by nature and human activities. For example, the voracious burning of fossil fuels for energy is artificially amping up the carbon dioxide greenhouse effect. This results in rising temperatures that are altering the planet’s climate system, causing catastrophic climate change.\nHere, we take a look at what the greenhouse effect is, what causes it, and how we can temper its contributions to our changing climate.",
        "content": "What is the greenhouse effect?\nThe sun radiates energy, part of which is absorbed by Earth, and the rest bounces back into space. However, greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere trap some of this reflected energy, preventing it from entirely escaping into space, and thereby contributing to the heating of our planet. This natural warming process can be observed on Earth and on other planets within our solar system. This is a very simple greenhouse effect definition. Let’s dig a little deeper into what causes the greenhouse effect?How does the greenhouse effect work?\nThe greenhouse gas effect is caused by certain gases called greenhouse gases. The molecules of greenhouse gases absorb and reemit thermal radiation, much like a tuning fork absorbs and reemits sound waves tuned to its frequency. Greenhouse gas molecules release some of this thermal radiation back to Earth’s surface, contributing to the build-up of heat. A simple greenhouse effect diagram can be helpful to describe the greenhouse effect, and what greenhouse gases are doing to the Earth’s atmosphere.What are greenhouse gases?\nGreenhouse gases are – for the most part – a natural phenomenon; they trap heat from sunlight reflecting off Earth’s surface. For more than ten thousand years, during the epoch that saw humanity evolve from hunter gatherers to agricultural and urban civilizations, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere remained relatively stable, maintaining Earth’s surface temperature at a warm level.\nSo, which gases contribute to the greenhouse effect? While they come in many forms, the following are the main examples of greenhouse gases:\n\nCarbon dioxide (CO2): Accounting for almost 80 % of global human-caused emissions, carbon dioxide can stick around for quite a while. Some CO2 is absorbed quickly, but some will remain in the atmosphere for thousands of years.\nMethane (CH4): Methane persists in the atmosphere for around 12 years, which is less time than carbon dioxide, but it is much more potent in terms of the greenhouse effect.\nNitrous oxide (N2O): Nitrous oxide is a powerful greenhouse gas. It has a global warming potential which is around 270 times that of carbon dioxide on a hundred-year time scale, and it remains in the atmosphere, on average, a little more than a century.\nFluorinated gases: Emitted from a variety of manufacturing and industrial processes, fluorinated gases are human-made. There are four main categories: hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3).\nWater vapour (H2O): This is by far the most abundant greenhouse gas. Water vapour differs from other greenhouse gases in that the changes in its atmospheric concentrations are not linked to human activities directly, but rather to the warming that results from the other greenhouse gases we emit.\n\nBy increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, we’re amplifying Earth’s natural greenhouse effect and turning up the dial on global warming and climate change.\n\nSign up for email updates\nRegister for resources and updates on sustainability and environment related standards!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Subscribe\n\n\n\nAlmost done! \nYou are only one step away from joining the ISO subscriber list.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nWhy does a car get hot in the sun?\nLet’s take a couple of greenhouse effect examples: the sun warming a car and the sun warming a greenhouse. Visible light penetrates through the glass and warms the objects within. These objects absorb the light, and then radiate back to the air infrared light, as a way to release the energy. This infrared light, which can be felt as heat, has too long of a wavelength to pass back through the glass, getting trapped inside the car or greenhouse. This phenomenon is known as infrared radiation, and it explains why a car gets hot when it sits in the sun.\nSo, is the greenhouse effect good for us as human beings? Greenhouses work well to offer a good habitat for growing plants because they let the visible light in but trap the residual heat. However, trapping too much heat can be dangerous, the single most important example of this being global climate change.What do we mean by a runaway greenhouse effect?\nWe can learn a lot about climate change from our sister planet Venus, Earth’s nearest neighbour. Venus currently has a surface temperature of 450 °C (hot enough to turn lead to liquid, NASA scientists say) and an atmosphere dominated by 96 % carbon dioxide – making it a burning inferno. But it wasn’t always that way. In fact, at one time, it may have had an Earth-like climate.\nWhat happened on Venus? Several billion years ago, a runaway greenhouse effect turned all surface water into vapour, which then leaked slowly into space. This occurs when a planet absorbs more energy from the sun than it can radiate back to space.\nCould this scenario happen on Earth? Even burning all of the planet’s fossil fuel resources, according to some scientists, would not necessarily take us down the road toward a climate meltdown. By studying why Venus’s climate went in such a different direction with regard to habitability, we can probably learn valuable lessons about climate change – and avoid reaching the point of no return.\nIn simple terms, “tipping points” in climate change are synonymous to a seesaw. Just as a little weight can tip a seesaw and make it difficult to return to its original position, in the climate system, tipping points represent critical levels where small changes can lead to big and often irreversible shifts in weather patterns. Once these points are crossed, they can cause a chain reaction, with more emissions entering the atmosphere. For example, thawing permafrost releases methane, and wildfires increase carbon dioxide levels.Standards solutions\nTo avoid unpredictable and uncontrollable changes in climate, humanity needs to act swiftly and in coordination, implementing comprehensive strategies to reduce carbon emissions, conserve biodiversity, and transition towards sustainable living globally. An important tool for informed action is to monitor Earth’s temperature and greenhouse gas emissions carefully.\nThe good news is governments and organizations can now back net-zero commitments by credible action using ISO standards. For example, ISO 14064 is an International Standard for greenhouse gas accounting and verification. It provides organizations with a framework for measuring and reporting greenhouse gas emissions, as well as for verifying emission reductions and removals. This multi-part standard is an important tool to ensure transparency and uniformity across global efforts to combat climate change.\n\nISO 14064-1:2018Greenhouse gases\n\nISO 14067:2018Greenhouse gases — Carbon footprint of products\n\nISO 14068-1:2023Climate change management — Part 1: Carbon neutralityAvoiding greenhouse effect chaos\nToday, concentrations of human-caused greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are higher than ever and the planet is heating up. The good news is that we have the ability to rein in greenhouse gas emissions – by overhauling our energy systems, habits and lifestyles.\nUnderstanding the greenhouse effect and the role of different gases is pivotal to mitigating the impacts of climate change. By adhering to International Standards to measure and report our emissions, we guarantee that our efforts are as effective and coordinated as possible. For just as the greenhouse gas emissions from a century ago still contribute to the climate change we see today, the emissions we release today will continue to impact us long into the future.\nQuiz\n\n\n\n\n\n            What is a greenhouse gas? \n\n\nGreenhouse gases, or “GHG” for short, are atmospheric gases that trap heat from sunlight reflecting off the Earth’s surface. This is a naturally occurring phenomenon and helps keep our planet at a suitable temperature for life. However, since the start of the industrial revolution, humans have been releasing additional greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, altering the gas composition of our air.\n\n\n\n\n            Which of the following is not a greenhouse gas: methane; nitrogen; carbon dioxide; nitrous oxide?\n\n\nAnswer: Nitrogen\nNitrogen is not a greenhouse gas as it cannot absorb heat and contribute to the greenhouse effect. However, excess nitrogen in the environment in a reactive form – which comes from the use of synthetic fertilizers, the discharge of wastewater or the combustion of fossil fuels – pollutes land, water and air. The compounds created when nitrogen reacts with other substances, for example nitrous oxide, also exacerbate climate change."

        "content": "What is an environmental management system?\nSo what is an EMS, and why is environmental management necessary? An EMS model is a framework of policies, procedures and practices that helps organizations manage and reduce their impact on the environment. It provides a structured approach to identify, evaluate and mitigate environmental impacts.\n\nThe primary goals of an EMS are to ensure:\nCompliance with environmental requirements\nThe efficient use of resources\nWaste reduction and minimal pollution\nThe continuous improvement of environmental performance\n\nThere are various examples of environmental management systems, but one of the best known and most widely used is ISO 14001. This International Standard provides a systematic approach to environmental management and is recognized globally.\nAt first glance, an EMS might seem similar to a quality management system (QMS), but there are some important distinctions. The main difference between a QMS and an EMS is that a QMS (such as ISO 9001) usually focuses on improving performance related to products, services and customer outcomes. An EMS, on the other hand, has a specific focus on environmental impact. It allows organizations to establish an environmental management plan, set environmental controls, and track their environmental management objectives.\n\nSign up for email updates\nRegister for resources and updates on sustainability and environment related standards!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Subscribe\n\n\n\nAlmost done! \nYou are only one step away from joining the ISO subscriber list.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nKey EMS components\nThe key components of environmental management include:\n\nEnvironmental policy: A statement that outlines an organization’s commitment to environmental sustainability.\nPlanning: This involves identifying environmental objectives, setting targets and establishing programmes to achieve them.\nImplementation: This stage involves putting plans into action, allocating resources and assigning responsibilities.\nChecking: Regular monitoring of performance against objectives and targets is critical to ensure the timely implementation of corrective actions.\nManagement review: A formal review of the EMS supports its continued effectiveness and suitability.\n\nUnderstanding and implementing an EMS is crucial for businesses looking to reduce their environmental impact and contribute to a more sustainable future. It provides a systematic and effective approach to environmental management, helping organizations achieve their environmental goals while maintaining profitability.Benefits of implementing an EMS in your business\nThe benefits of implementing an environmental management system are numerous. One of the biggest is that it helps fulfil compliance obligations. By implementing an EMS, businesses can ensure that they meet relevant environmental requirements. This not only helps to avoid legal issues and penalties for non-compliance, but also demonstrates a commitment to environmental stewardship.\n\nAn EMS can also help address issues outside the realm of compliance, such as energy or water management, and can promote stronger operational controls and staff accountability. Some of these benefits are:\nReduced risks: This proactive approach helps prevent incidents that could harm the environment, and exposure to litigation, fines or sanctions, and reputational damage.\nEnhanced image: By demonstrating a commitment to environmental sustainability through an EMS, businesses can attract environmentally conscious customers and build trust in their brand.\nIncreased efficiency: By identifying and addressing areas where resources are being wasted – such as energy, water or material management – organizations can optimize their operations and reduce costs.\nContinuous improvements: A systematic approach helps businesses to continuously improve their environmental performance by setting goals, implementing measures, monitoring progress, and making necessary adjustments.\n\nUltimately, by integrating an EMS into their operations, businesses can foster a culture of sustainability and contribute to a more environmentally responsible future. Whether it’s about waste reduction, pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, conserving resources, or promoting other eco-friendly practices, an EMS empowers organizations to make positive environmental changes while still achieving their business goals.Types of environmental management systems\nThere are several types of EMS and approaches to environmental management, so it’s important for organizations to choose one that works best for them. Companies could opt to develop their own bespoke system from scratch that puts their objectives, resources and strategies at the core of their environmental management plan. An in-house EMS will gel seamlessly with an organization’s operations, but they take a great deal of time and capital to develop effectively.\nA more practical, cost-efficient approach is to follow existing best practices. Using international standards and guidelines allows a business to focus on getting its environmental management right without needing to sink resources into developing its own EMS system. Standards such as ISO 14001 are already aligned with compliance obligations, providing approaches and guidelines that are easy for businesses to follow.\nWhat is ISO 14001?\nISO’s environmental standards translate passion into effective environmental action. ISO 14001 provides the criteria for an EMS that an organization can use to identify, track and enhance its environmental performance, fulfil its compliance obligations and achieve its environmental objectives. The standard can be used in whole or in part by any organization – regardless of size or industry – that wants to strengthen its environmental action; whether that’s by improving the sustainability of a product, a company’s operations or the services it provides.What is the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle?\nISO 14001 is based on the continuous improvement model Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA). Through the PDCA cycle, businesses can stay ahead of changing environmental needs and expectations. They can identify areas for improvement, implement innovative solutions, and track their progress towards their environmental objectives. This iterative process ensures that the EMS remains effective and aligned with the organization’s business goals.\nPractical steps to implement a successful EMS\nImplementing an EMS can seem like a daunting task but, with a clear plan and stakeholder buy-in, any business can successfully integrate the methodology of environmental management into their operations. The following steps may serve as a useful starting point:\n\nAssess environmental impact: Organizations should conduct an environmental review to identify the areas where they have the most significant impact on the environment. This will help to prioritize their efforts and set goals for improvement.\nEstablish environmental management objectives: Based on the findings from the environmental review, businesses should set specific and measurable objectives that align with their goals. These objectives might relate to reducing waste, conserving resources or improving energy efficiency.\nDevelop an implementation plan: Businesses should then create a detailed plan that outlines the actions needed to achieve their environmental management objectives. This plan should include timelines, responsible parties and required resources.\nEngage employees: Organizations should engage their employees by communicating the importance of the EMS and their role in its success. Businesses should invest in training and resources to ensure that everyone understands their role and responsibilities in contributing to environmental sustainability.\nImplement monitoring and reporting systems: Businesses should put in place systems to track and measure their progress towards objectives. Regularly reviewing and analysing the data to identify areas for improvement and celebrate successes should be key actions.\nContinuously improve: Organizations should use the PDCA cycle to continuously improve their environmental performance. Set new objectives, implement measures, monitor progress and make necessary adjustments – all these ensure the EMS remains effective and aligned with business goals.\nISO 14090 Adaptation to climate changeISO 14064-1 Greenhouse gasesISO 14068-1 Climate change management — Part 1: Carbon neutralityThe importance of continuous improvement\nContinuous improvement is a fundamental aspect of any successful EMS. In order to effectively manage and reduce their environmental impact, organizations must be prepared to regularly measure their progress and change plans if they find a better way to do something.\nPrioritizing continuous improvement allows businesses to achieve long-term sustainability and reap the benefits of reduced environmental impact and increased efficiency. It enables organizations to respond to new environmental requirements, industry trends and consumer demands, while staying competitive in the market.\nBy embracing the PDCA cycle and consistently striving for better environmental performance, businesses can make a lasting impact on their operations and contribute to a more sustainable future.\n\nSign up for email updates\nRegister for resources and updates on sustainability and environment related standards!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Subscribe\n\n\n\nAlmost done! \nYou are only one step away from joining the ISO subscriber list.

You get a phone call from a business partner who needs to contact your colleague and asks you to check her calendar to see when she is free. While in essence quite different, both these scenarios are requests to access personal data.\nBut what if the person requesting access to personal data is not who he or she claims to be? In general, there are two things you need to consider when asked to give out somebody’s personal information: the identity of the person asking for the data, and whether they have the right to access that data. The technical term for this is “access control”. Various access control examples can be found in security systems in password-coded doors, fob-controlled gates, badges, biometric systems, motion detectors, and so forth.\nA key component of information security, access control allows for streamlined control of movement around facilities or networks. In other words, it restricts the areas people can and cannot enter – be it a room or a computer. Back in the day, the simplest form of access control system would have been a standard lock and key. Today, it’s more likely to be an “access card” granting you entry to a secured area. Here, we take a closer look at how best to manage, monitor and track who has access to your door.",
        "content": "Security deep dive\nWhen controlling access to an organization’s private information, you have to address both physical and logical access. Physical access refers to buildings, devices and documents while logical access refers to computer or system access. The technologies for dealing with each of them are quite different. Physical access control uses keys and badges to grant entry to a secured space, whereas logical access control employs advanced password programs and biometric security features.\nRather than handling user and access rights within each application, identity and access management solutions have introduced a centralized and more robust way of managing identities and regulating each user’s level of access to a given system. As endpoints proliferate across an organization, driven by bring-your-own-device policies and an expansion in the use of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, more control is needed. The solution is network access control (NAC), which provides a way to embed access control and endpoint security policies within an organization’s network infrastructure. This means that when a user tries to connect to a network, the NAC system holds the connection while it performs a risk assessment.Why is access control used? \nWith large amounts of sensitive data stored electronically, the need to protect our informational assets has never been greater. Cyber threats evolve daily, requiring ever stricter safety measures, and keys and simple passwords no longer do the job. What you now need is a robust access control system that can help secure physical and confidential data, reduce admin costs, and keep your customers and staff safe.\nAccess control also helps organizations meet regulatory compliance requirements, such as the PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) and the HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act). On another level, the ISO/IEC 27001 standard on information security also requires management to audit, and then mitigate, all of their organization’s vulnerabilities and cyber risks.\n\nSign up for email updates\nRegister for additional resources and updates on IT and related technologies!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Subscribe\n\n\n\nAlmost done! \nYou are only one step away from joining the ISO subscriber list.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nHow does access control work?\nProtecting identities is the core function of identity management, which provides several access control areas to make it clear what kind of access is being granted and to whom it is granted. This is only a superficial definition of access control, so let’s take a deeper look into how it all works. Identity management (IdM) draws a distinction between access control to resources within a domain and access control to the IdM configuration itself.\nTo make access control rules simple to implement, identity management divides access control definitions into three basic categories: \n\nSelf-service rules, which define what operations a user can perform on their own personal entry\nDelegation rules, which allow a specific user group to perform write/edit operations on specific attributes for users in another user group\nRole-based rules, which create special access control groups that have much broader authority over all types of entities\nDifferent types of access control\nAll these rules are integrated into a variety of access control systems, which determine how access permissions are assigned and controlled within an organization. These include:\n\nDiscretionary access control (DAC): With DAC models, the data owner decides to grant access rights based on rules that they specify. DAC is the least restrictive, and therefore the least recommended, type of access control for commercial and business security.\nMandatory access control (MAC): MAC was developed using a non-discretionary model in which one person (e.g. the Chief Security Officer) has sole discretion over access permissions and security clearance. MAC subjects and objects are assigned clearances and labels, respectively, such as “confidential”, “secret” and “top secret”. This type of access control is best suited to organizations that require high security and confidentiality. \nRole-based access control (RBAC): Under this model, access is granted based on the person’s job function and the resources required to do their job. Key security principles, such as “least privilege” and “separation of privilege”, are employed to give users the minimum level of access required to perform their role. RBAC is a user-friendly access control system, which allows admins to group users and adjust permissions from a central database.\nAttribute-based access control (ABAC): In contrast to the role-based access control method of RBAC, ABAC is a complex strategy that assigns or denies access to users based on a set of attributes assigned by the owner or administrator. While more complicated than RBAC, it gives admins the flexibility to make decisions according to context and evolving levels of risk.\nRule-based access control (RuBAC): RuBAC involves defining the rules that govern access to a resource; these are often based on conditions such as “only users in the finance department can access financial data”.\nChoosing the right software\nSo how do you know which access control system is best suited to your space? Network access control is a rapidly growing market segment which offers numerous types of access control software solutions. Some connect you directly to a control panel, and some don’t; some use a server, and some don’t. The one you choose will depend on the size of your organization, the number of devices you operate and the protection levels required. \nLet’s break it down for the sake of simplicity. At a glance, there are three different types of access control software on the market today – server-based, embedded, and hosted – each with their own features and applications.\n\nServer-based access control: Typically found in large organizations, these are on-premise access control systems that rely on local servers to host and run software. Access control systems on a local network are only available on site, and don’t offer the flexibility of remote access. Here, the server is on a closed network that can only be accessed by other devices within that network. While this is very secure, it can be inconvenient as it requires a full IT team to purchase and renew software licences and maintain the servers.\nWeb-based access control: Also known as embedded access control, browser-based solutions include a web application. For the application to operate, there is no requirement for Internet access; it connects to the LAN (local area network) and can be accessed from any device within the LAN. However, it’s still best to have a reliable Internet connection as this type of access control system allows programming and maintenance from any Internet browser, avoiding costly software installations onsite. \nCloud-based access control: Unlike the other two types of access control, cloud-based software is hosted by remote data centres (usually managed by a third party) and accessed via software and mobile apps. Under this approach, you can control your entire campus, including multiple buildings, from one admin panel. Because the system syncs in the cloud, an Internet connection is needed to review the admin panel and make updates or changes. Cloud-based access control systems increase the security and scalability of your operation, while also reducing overhead costs and operating fees.\nISO/IEC 27001 Information security management systemsISO/IEC 29146 Security techniques — A framework for access managementAccess control: future perspectives\nThe way we live and work is shifting rapidly, forcing organizations to make drastic changes in order to meet their information security and compliance requirements. Until recently, security convergence has mostly focused on merging virtual and physical access control systems; today, however, remote and hybrid work models are driving new security demands. With fewer people physically at office buildings, and more flexibility in how they access workplace assets, the future of access control is likely to be fashioned by the continued development of new technologies. \nAs time unfolds, we may see the use of more sophisticated biometric identifiers or technologies such as IoT and AI-based systems. The most important, however, will be to allow access control systems to be connected to a whole network of devices, giving IT teams a more comprehensive and coordinated approach to security. When it comes to access control, we’re in for an exciting future – one that’s all at once intelligent, adaptive and reliable."

Data breaches happen daily, and in too many places at once to keep count. They remind us that, regardless of our information security investments, business-critical resources can be compromised if access is not protected.\nOrganizations depend on a variety of systems, applications and devices to run their operations, and users require access to these resources to do their jobs efficiently. Managing this can be a challenge, especially in large corporations with hundreds or thousands of users requiring personalized access. Identity and access management adds a layer of security by tracking, managing and securing the identities of individuals and their associated data. It helps keep track of who is who, so that people can access the information they are authorized to see and make the transactions they are permitted to make.",
        "content": "What is identity management?\nIdentity management is the process of managing user identities and access privileges in a centralized way. It involves recording and controlling identities within an organization and enforcing identity governance policies. Simply put, your online identity is the profile that identifies who you are when using a network, whereas your access refers to what permissions you have once you’re logged in. Together, they form an important part of how you interact with technology – it’s how computers know it’s really you attempting to log in instead of someone else.Identity management in action\nThrough identity and access management (IAM), only specified users in an organization are allowed to access and handle sensitive information. Here are a few examples of identity management at work:\n\nIdentity creation and maintenance: By creating automated workflows for scenarios like a new hire or a role transition, IAM centralizes the identity and access management life cycle of a company’s employees. This improves processing time for access and identity changes and reduces errors.\nEntitlement management: Life-cycle entitlements are assigned to individuals and their roles. For example, a production operator is able to view an online work procedure but may not be allowed to modify it. On the other hand, a supervisor will have the authority not only to view but to modify the file or create new ones.\nIdentity proofing: Identity is at the core of a citizen’s everyday actions. Once the state has implemented a civil register, IAM enables governments to grant people the right to access their data (birth certificate, driver’s licence, etc.) and prove their identity.\n\nA number of identity and access management systems use role-based access control (RBAC). Under this approach, there are predefined job roles with specific sets of access privileges. For instance, if an HR employee is put in charge of training, it makes little sense to also give them access to pay role and salary files. There are many other forms of automatic access control that each come with a variety of features and technology.\n\nSign up for email updates\nRegister for additional resources and updates on IT and related technologies!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Subscribe\n\n\n\nAlmost done! \nYou are only one step away from joining the ISO subscriber list.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nCommon features of identity management\nMany different forms of identity management software exist on the market and there is no official definition of what they must and must not include. However, a couple of essential features stand out:\n\nSingle sign-on (SSO): This is when users can access multiple applications and services from a single location, avoiding the need for different usernames and passwords.\nTwo-factor authentication: This involves verifying someone’s identity not just with their username and password, but also with another piece of information like a PIN or a token.\n\nOther features of identity management may include automatic provisioning of user accounts, password management, workflow, and compliance and audit services. In recent years, a new generation of identity management technologies has emerged, which focuses on ease of use in addition to security. Some examples are biometric authentication (such as fingerprints or facial recognition), multi-factor authentication (requiring several verification factors), and identity federation, whereby the responsibility for an individual’s or entity’s authentication is delegated to a trusted external party. SSO is an important aspect of federated ID management.\nThese key features of identity management are shared by nearly all of today’s identity management systems (IMS). An IMS is an online platform that helps organizations manage a range of identities in a secure and efficient manner. It integrates with various other systems within an organization, such as HR systems, e-commerce platforms and accounting software.How does identity management work?\nBroadly speaking, identity management systems perform three main tasks: identification, authentication and authorization. This enables the right people, depending on their job functions, to access the tools they need to perform their assigned duties – without granting them access to those they don’t need.\nIdentity and access – what’s the difference? The terms “identity management” and “access management” are often used interchangeably, but they are two distinct concepts. The crucial difference is that identity management deals with user accounts (authentication) while access management deals with permissions and privileges (authorization).\nLet’s take an example. When a user enters their login credentials, their identity is being checked against a database to verify if the entered credentials match the ones stored in the database – this is authentication. Once the user’s identity has been established, they are then granted access to the resources their account is cleared for – that’s authorization.Identity management: what’s in it for you?\nAn identity management system is a valuable tool for protecting the information and resources of organizations of any size. It allows you to securely store user data and manage user access privileges, providing a secure and reliable way to keep your operations running smoothly.\nThe benefits of identity management include the following:\n\nIncreased security: An IMS helps protect your organization from unauthorized access and theft of user data.\nImproved efficiency: With an IMS, you can efficiently manage user login procedures and track user activity across multiple platforms using a single set of credentials.\nReduced processing time/cost: An IMS’s automated workflows allow you to easily manage and administer user accounts, saving time and money on administrative tasks.\nEnhanced compliance: With an IMS, you can easily ensure compliance with regulations and standards, such as GDPR and HIPAA (see below).\nDeploying an identity management system\nThe implementation of a sound identity management solution does not guarantee complete security, but adopting the following principles can make you less vulnerable to breaches and attacks from malicious actors. Here are a few tips to consider:\n\nImplement strong authentication methods (such as multi-factor authentication) to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.\nRegularly review access control policies to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive information and resources.\nMonitor and audit access to sensitive information and resources to detect and prevent unauthorized access.\nFrequently update user accounts to ensure they remain relevant and accurate.\nImplement a password management solution to reduce the risk of password-related security incidents, such as password reuse or password theft.\nWhat it means for compliance\nIf identity and access management processes are not effectively controlled, you may be in non-compliance with industry standards or government regulations. The world is moving towards stricter regulations and standards for identity management – such as the European GDPR (which requires explicit consent from users for data collection) and the NIST 800-63 Digital Identity Guidelines in the US (a roadmap for IAM best practices).\nSeveral protocols exist to support strong IAM policies by securing data and ensuring its integrity during transfer. Generally known as “Authentication, Authorization, Accounting”, or AAA, these identity and access management protocols provide security standards to simplify access management, aid compliance and create a uniform system for managing interactions between users and systems.\nAlthough ISO compliance is not a legal requirement, ISO standards naturally align with the regulations of various sector. So complying with ISO/IEC 27001 for information security can prevent your organization from getting into legal trouble over crucial aspects of identity management. Based around segregation of duty and a “one user, one ID” policy, it demonstrates that your corporate information is appropriately controlled.ISO/IEC 27001 Information security management systemsISO/IEC 24760-1 IT security and privacy — A framework for identity managementISO/IEC 27018 Protection of personally identifiable information (PII) in public clouds acting as PII processorsTowards advanced identity management\nComplex compliance and security requirements are putting organizations under pressure more than ever before to protect their information, and challenge conventional ways of managing users’ identities. Half a decade ago, passwords were as close as you would get to a digital identity. But modern approaches to authentication require more than just a password. The widespread adoption of cloud computing, whose scalability and flexibility make it an attractive proposition for most organizations, has placed a new layer of stress on information security.\nToday, passwordless logins using biometrics or multi-factor authentication provide an alternative to traditional authentication – but that’s not enough. When it comes to securing data in multi-cloud environments, IT professionals view encryption as a critical security control. Storing identities on a blockchain has emerged as a solution that can provide immutable records of a given system without a centralized authority to manage them. As we contemplate our IAM future, it may not be long before blockchain-based identity systems become the norm for keeping a user’s data safe and secure."

However, when they see a patient online, they may lack the necessary equipment to conduct the visit properly. One reason for this is that virtual care requires a lot of specialized equipment. For each instrument used during an in-person visit, there is an equivalent telehealth device that someone has to buy.\nGiven the number of different medical instruments used in a single visit, the list of telemedicine equipment you need to buy can seem quite overwhelming. The high costs, complexity and maintenance of these specialized tools may deter smaller healthcare practices and those operating in low-income areas from entering the telehealth space. In the long term, this could lead to a two-tier healthcare industry where high-quality care is not equally available to all.\nAs a healthcare provider embarking on the telehealth journey, don’t be daunted by the bewildering array of telehealth devices available. Instead, let’s examine how investing in these essential tools can help optimize your telehealth services, foster wider adoption and ensure equitable access to quality healthcare for all.",
        "content": "What is a telehealth device?\nA telehealth device refers to any medical device employed to deliver healthcare services remotely. These devices, which range from simple webcams to sophisticated digital stethoscopes, enable healthcare providers to interact with patients without the need for them to be physically present. They help conduct medical examinations, monitor vital signs, and provide consultations or treatments at a distance. Fundamentally, telehealth devices are the hardware that underpins the virtual healthcare infrastructure.Types of telemedicine equipment\nNow that you’re up to speed on telehealth – i.e. delivering healthcare services remotely through telecommunication technologies – it’s time to explore what you need to get started. Aside from a dependable Internet connection, various types of telehealth devices are used to bridge the physical gap between patient and provider. Here’s a rundown of the essentials:\n\nTelehealth peripherals like high-definition cameras, digital otoscopes, dermatoscopes and cameras enable healthcare providers to conduct detailed examinations during virtual visits.\nMobile electronic devices, including wearable fitness trackers, blood pressure monitors, glucose meters and pulse oximeters, collect and transmit patient data to healthcare providers in real time.\nMobile health apps empower patients to monitor their own health, track symptoms, communicate with healthcare providers, and access educational resources remotely.\nTelehealth accessories, such as webcams, microphones, headphones and privacy screens, enhance the audiovisual quality and privacy of virtual consultations.\n\nWhile these devices hold the power to revolutionize healthcare as we know it, they can’t do it alone. To unlock their full potential, telemedicine equipment requires a reliable, effective and coordinated telehealth system to bring everything together. Central to this system is a robust telemedicine software platform.A telemedicine platform for your practice\nTelehealth devices depend on reliable software to function effectively. Whether it’s secure video conferencing for face-to-face consultations or virtual health records providing seamless access to patient data, telemedicine software is the glue that binds the components of virtual healthcare together.\nTelemedicine software platforms are a comprehensive digital solution designed to facilitate the delivery of remote healthcare. They typically encompass a wide range of features and functionalities tailored to support the entire spectrum of telehealth services, from patient consultations to administrative tasks. These platforms provide an extensive suite of capabilities, including:\n\nSecure video conferencing for confidential communication between healthcare providers and patients\nIntegration with electronic health records systems giving instant access to patient medical history, lab results and other pertinent data during telehealth visits\nAdvanced appointment scheduling to streamline the booking process for patients and providers, complete with automated reminders and notifications\nIntegration with wearable devices, such as fitness trackers, blood pressure monitors and glucose meters, enabling real-time monitoring of patients’ vital signs and health metrics\nE-prescription management allowing providers to send electronic prescriptions directly to pharmacies\nPayment processing solutions for streamlined billing and payment collection\n\nIn addition, many telemedicine platforms offer patient portals where individuals can access their medical records, schedule appointments, communicate with providers and engage in telehealth visits from a single digital environment. Some even have mobile apps that extend the platform’s functionality to smartphones and tablets. Now, patients can enjoy telehealth services from anywhere, enhancing convenience and accessibility.\n\nSign up for email updates\nRegister for additional resources and updates on health topics and related standards!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Subscribe\n\n\n\nAlmost done! \nYou are only one step away from joining the ISO subscriber list.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nTelehealth privacy and security\nWhile conventional telemedicine software platforms offer basic telehealth services through a patient portal, this usually isn’t enough to meet the current expectations of patients. To enhance the patient experience, healthcare providers can leverage the advantages of an integrated customer relationship management (CRM) system, a central repository where providers can store patient data, track medical interactions, and share this information with colleagues.\nWith increasing amounts of data being stored, integrated CRM systems are susceptible to various types of cyber-attacks, which can jeopardize the security and privacy of sensitive information. It is therefore crucial that healthcare providers implement robust CRM security measures to protect against cyber threats and safeguard patient privacy. These measures may include anything from encryption to access controls, authentication and audit trails. This not only ensures providers stay on the right side of data protection laws, it also reinforces patient trust.\nBeyond managing contacts, integrated CRM systems serve as essential patient communication tools. They help manage appointments and referrals, track patient medical history and simplify billing and coding. In essence, they streamline processes, allowing healthcare providers to focus on what truly matters – their patients. But that’s not all – integrated CRM systems also lend a hand in targeted marketing efforts and seamlessly integrate with electronic health record systems and other applications, all aimed at delivering an unmatched patient experience.Data-driven insights\nTelehealth isn’t just about bridging the gap between patients and healthcare providers – it also provides access to a wealth of actionable data. Take medical imaging, for instance, which plays a crucial role in the war on cancer. Thanks to recent advancements in AI-assisted diagnosis, medical imaging software is revolutionizing how health professionals view and interpret imaging data. Deep learning algorithms excel at detecting and interpreting anomalies in X-rays, MRIs and CT scans, facilitating collaborative decision-making among healthcare professionals.\nWhile imaging technology is highly effective in delivering accurate diagnoses, a patient’s symptoms can evolve over time. This is where long-term devices, such as wearables, step in. Widely used in the healthcare industry, wearable health devices, such as smartwatches, fitness trackers and health monitors, provide real-time physiological data that enables immediate interventions and improved patient outcomes.\nAs the medical imaging software market continues to grow, so does the demand for sophisticated and specialized software solutions and mobile applications. With imaging technology becoming sleeker, faster and more efficient, work is already underway to integrate medical imaging software into our wearable health devices, and – of course – into our smartphones.So what are the barriers?\nDespite its overwhelming potential, telemedicine equipment can impede the widespread adoption of telehealth services. Overcoming these barriers is crucial to ensuring that telehealth is truly accessible for everyone. Key challenges include:\n\nHigh costs: Telemedicine equipment often requires substantial upfront investment, ongoing maintenance and specialized technical support, which can place a strain on healthcare providers with limited resources.\nLack of interoperability: Integration issues with various healthcare platforms, electronic health records and other technology stacks can hamper the quality and effectiveness of telehealth services. These disconnects often stem from technology disparities or a lack of harmonized standards.\nQuality assurance: Maintaining the accuracy and reliability of medical equipment, such as remote stethoscopes or otoscopes, requires regular calibration and quality checks.\nBandwidth and connectivity: A stable Internet connection is crucial for telehealth, but it can be unreliable in rural or underserved areas. This means telemedicine devices must be able to operate effectively even amid fluctuating network speeds.\nData security and privacy: Telemedicine equipment handles sensitive patient data, making it a prime target for cyber-attacks. Protecting this data requires robust encryption, secure data transfer protocols, and compliance with national and international healthcare regulations.\nInternational Standards as a remedy\nThe reality is that telemedicine equipment must comply with a multitude of laws and regulations, adding layers of complexity for both manufacturers and providers. Regulations can vary widely across different regions and industries, covering everything from patient data protection to clinical practice standards and reimbursement policies. To navigate these complexities, International Standards, like ISO/TR 16056-1 and ISO/TR 16056-2, are essential to ensure the responsible development and adoption of telemedicine equipment. By harmonizing manufacturing processes and promoting interoperability between platforms, they facilitate a more connected and collaborative telehealth ecosystem.\nMeanwhile, the ISO 81001 series addresses the intricacies of health software and IT systems (including medical devices), focusing on safety, interoperability and data protection. It establishes foundational principles and a common language, which are indispensable when different systems and stakeholders need to communicate or integrate effectively. Providing a full life-cycle model, from product design through its use and even decommissioning, the standard details critical governance and knowledge transfer aspects such as quality and safety management.\nTogether, these International Standards provide a robust foundation for designing and operating telemedicine equipment that complies with regulatory requirements, ensuring patient safety and fostering innovation in healthcare delivery.\n\nISO/TR 16056-1:2004Interoperability of telehealth systems and networks\n\nISO 81001-1:2021Health software and health IT systems safety, effectiveness and securityA bright future for telehealth equipment\nLooking ahead, several trends in telemedicine equipment are set to redefine the landscape of remote healthcare. While many providers were introduced to telehealth through simple videoconferencing, the next generation of telemedicine technology has much more to offer. Clinicians will use natural language processing to automatically take notes during online consultations. Specialists will advise from afar on emergency procedures. And patients the world over will enjoy the highest level of care.\nThe integration of AI into telemedicine equipment heralds exciting new developments. The latest innovations in AI-assisted diagnostics help providers work more efficiently, keep patients connected via wearable health devices for remote patient monitoring, and even use robotics to bring specialized care to previously underserved regions.

        "published_day": "Not specified",
        "abstract": "As a child, you may recall using symbols to write coded messages to your classmates that no one else could understand. More seriously, codes and ciphers are used for information security in computer systems and networks to protect sensitive and commercial information from unauthorized access when it is at rest or in transit. Uses include anything from keeping military secrets to transmitting financial data safely across the Internet. \nCryptography is an important computer security tool that deals with techniques to store and transmit information in ways that prevent unauthorized access or interference.",
        "content": "How cryptography keeps communication secret and safe \nThe cryptographic process of scrambling text from a readable form to an unintelligible form – known as cipher text – is called encryption. Sending secret or private messages as cipher text is a typical use of cryptography. Once the cipher text is received, it is descrambled by the authorized recipient back to its readable form. The descrambling (or decryption) is performed with the use of an encryption key, which serves to prevent third parties from reading these messages. \nEncryption methods have been used by many civilizations throughout history to prevent non-authorized people from understanding messages. Julius Caesar is credited for one of the earliest forms of cipher – the “Caesar Cipher” – to convey messages to his generals. With increasing sophistication, cryptography now plays a vital role in ensuring the privacy, data confidentiality, data integrity and authentication in computer systems and networks. In today’s world, where the majority of our personal and professional communications and transactions are conducted online, cryptography is more important than ever. \n\nSign up for email updates\nRegister for additional resources and updates on IT and related technologies!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Subscribe\n\n\n\nAlmost done! \nYou are only one step away from joining the ISO subscriber list.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nTypes of cryptography systems \nCryptography refers to the techniques and algorithms that are used today for secure communication and data in storage. It incorporates mathematics, computer science, electronics and digital signal processing. Broadly speaking, there are four types of cryptography systems: \n\nSymmetric-key cryptography (or “secret key”): In this type of system, both the sender and the receiver share the same key, which is used to encrypt and decrypt the message. \nAsymmetric-key cryptography (or “public key”): In this type of cryptography system, there are two keys – one public and one private; these form a pair and are related mathematically. To apply asymmetric cryptography, the sender uses the public key of the intended recipient to encode the message, and then sends it on its way. When the message arrives, only the recipient’s private key can be used to decode it, meaning that a stolen message is of no use to the thief without the corresponding private key. Encryption mechanisms are the focus of ISO/IEC 18033, a suite of International Standards that specifies a number of asymmetric ciphers. The multipart series includes identity-based ciphers, block ciphers, stream ciphers, and homomorphic encryption. \nCryptographic key management: This type of system is crucial for protecting the keys used in both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. It includes a set of processes covering the entire “life cycle” of a key, including its generation, exchange and distribution, storage, use, safe destruction and replacement. If the key management is weak, then the protection of encrypted data is weak. There are a number of International Standards relating to key management (e.g. ISO/IEC 11770) and key generation (e.g. ISO/IEC 18031 and ISO/IEC 18032). \nCryptographic hash function: This is a technique that converts a string of data of any length into a hashed output (a digest of the input) of fixed length. Hash functions have many applications such as in digital signatures, MACs (message authentication codes), and checksums (to check data corruption). International Standards that specify hash functions include ISO/IEC 9797-2, ISO/IEC 9797-3 and ISO/IEC 10118. \nInformation security principles and uses of cryptography \nThe key principles of information security are confidentiality, integrity and availability. Cryptography is an important tool that helps to preserve two of these principles: \n\nData confidentiality ensures that data is not disclosed to unauthorized parties. Cryptographic techniques such as encryption can be used to protect the confidentiality of data by making it unreadable to those who don’t have the proper decryption key. \nData integrity ensures that data has not been modified or corrupted. One example for International Standards on data integrity is ISO/IEC 9797, which specifies algorithms for calculating message authentication codes. \n\nIn addition to these key information security objectives, cryptography is used to achieve: \nEntity authentication\nBy checking knowledge of a secret, entity authentication verifies the identity of the sender. Various crypto-based mechanisms and protocols can be used to achieve this, such as symmetric systems, digital signatures, zero-knowledge techniques and checksums. ISO/IEC 9798 is a series of standards that specifies entity authentication protocols and techniques. \nDigital signatures \nUsed to verify the authenticity of data, digital signatures confirm that the data originated from the signer and has not been changed. They are used, for example, in email messages, electronic documents and online payments. International Standards that specify digital signature schemes include ISO/IEC 9796, ISO/IEC 14888, ISO/IEC 18370 and ISO/IEC 20008. \nNon-repudiation \nCryptographic techniques such as digital signatures can be used to provide non-repudiation by ensuring that the sender and receiver of a message cannot deny that they, respectively, sent or received the message. The standard ISO/IEC 13888 describes techniques (symmetric and asymmetric) for the provision of non-repudiation services. \nLightweight cryptography \nLightweight cryptography is used in applications and technologies that are constrained in computational complexity: limiting factors can be memory, power and computing resources. The need for lightweight cryptography is expanding in our modern digital world. Constrained devices – for example IoT (Internet of Things) sensors or actuators like the ones switching on appliances in a so-called smart home – use lightweight symmetric cryptography. ISO/IEC 29192 is an eight-part standard that specifies various cryptographic techniques for lightweight applications. \nDigital rights management \nDigital rights management (DRM) protects the copyright of your digital content. DRM uses cryptographic software to ensure that only authorized users can have access to the material, modify or distribute it. \nElectronic commerce and online shopping \nSecure e-commerce is made possible by the use of asymmetric-key encryption. Cryptography plays an important role in online shopping as it protects credit card information and related personal details, as well as customers’ purchasing history and transactions. \nCryptocurrencies and blockchain \nA cryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses cryptographic techniques to secure transactions. Each cryptocurrency coin is validated via distributed ledger technologies (e.g. blockchain). A ledger, in this case, is a continuously growing list of records – known as blocks – that are linked together using cryptography. What are cryptographic algorithms? \nA cryptographic algorithm is a math-based process for encoding text and making it unreadable. Cryptographic algorithms are used to provide data confidentiality, data integrity and authentication, as well as for digital signatures and other security purposes. \nBoth DES (Data Encryption Standard) and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) are popular examples of symmetric-key algorithms, while prominent asymmetric-key algorithms include RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) and ECC (elliptic curve cryptography). \nElliptic curve cryptography (ECC) \nECC is an asymmetric-key technique based on the use of elliptic curves, which has applications in encryption and digital signatures, for example. ECC technology can be used to create faster, smaller and more efficient cryptographic keys. Elliptic curve techniques are covered in the multipart standard ISO/IEC 15946. \nStandards for cryptography \nCryptography has been the subject of intense standardization efforts resulting in a range of International Standards that encapsulate the knowledge and best practice of leading experts in the field. Internationally agreed ways of working make technology more secure and interoperable. By using cryptography standards, developers can rely on common definitions, as well as proven methods and techniques. Future-proofing cryptography \nToday, we are on the edge of a quantum revolution. The advent of quantum computing in the coming years will provide mankind with processing powers on a scale that traditional computers can never hope to match. While this offers countless possibilities for complex problem-solving, it also comes with corresponding security threats. That very same power could undermine much of today’s cybersecurity – including established cryptographic practices. \nQuantum cryptography is a method of encryption that applies the principles of quantum mechanics to provide secure communication. It uses quantum entanglement to generate a secret key to encrypt a message in two separate places, making it (almost) impossible for an eavesdropper to intercept without altering its contents. Hailed as the next big revolution in secure communication systems, quantum cryptography has the potential to be a real breakthrough for data that needs to stay private far into the future. \nThe new dawn of encryption is looking bright!"

While this can be complex, there are tools available to help you achieve these goals. Among the many existing solutions, quality management system software can be a useful tool to manage your quality operations and build an effective, safe and ethical supply chain.\nLet’s explore how.",
        "content": "Why quality management matters\nWe all know the importance of quality, but how do we define it? Perhaps the most often-quoted statement is that of Henry Ford: “Quality means doing it right when no one is looking.” In essence, “quality” describes how well a product or service meets its designated requirements. Therefore, it is underpinned by skillful execution, a commitment to excellence and intelligent planning.\nIn exploring how quality management software can help, it is important to distinguish between two related, but distinct, terms:\n\nQuality management: This takes place during the pre-implementation or planning stage, laying the groundwork as quality standards are established, responsibilities are assigned, specifications are determined, meetings are scheduled and metrics are defined to determine how well the project will perform.\nQuality control: This takes place during the project implementation stage as responsible parties ensure that outputs align with planning and assess performance against the specifications established during the quality management phase.\n\nIn other words, quality management and quality control are symbiotic aspects of the same process. While quality management dictates all quality assurance methods, quality control brings them together, like two seamlessly operating cogs in a wheel.What is quality management software?\nOften referred to as QMS software, this integrated management solution provides businesses with a platform or digital tools to help answer vital questions such as: “Is every product the best that it can be?” and “Can we prove our product meets industry standards?” This software centralizes and automates the often repetitive tasks and documentation needed to rigorously capture, analyse and act on data relating to quality management.\nEstablishing a robust enterprise quality management software makes it easier for businesses to monitor, measure and improve their quality standards. By turning data into intelligence and actionable insights, they can move from reacting to quality events to making predictive and, eventually, proactive quality management decisions.\nTo do this, QMS software acts as a centralized hub for managing product and service quality, integrating end-to-end traceability, communication, data management and real-time insights across an organization’s operations. It encompasses workflows, analytics and best practices, providing complete visibility and control over interdependent activities: quality planning, assurance, control and improvement.\nAt its most powerful, QMS software can help transform a business. The right tools turn an organization which is passively accumulating data, and struggling to maintain consistent high quality, into one that turns data into actionable information.\n\nSign up for email updates\nRegister to receive resources and updates on quality management and related standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Subscribe\n\n\n\nAlmost done! \nYou are only one step away from joining the ISO subscriber list.

This family of standards is based on a number of fundamental quality management principles. To achieve these principles, organizations must adopt quality controls which can be broken down into four key components:\n\nQuality control planning: Identifying quality goals and standards, how to meet them and how to track progress.\nQuality control: Physically inspecting and testing what was laid out at the planning stage to ensure it can be done. This involves confirming all standards are being met and identifying and correcting any errors in the production or service.\nQuality assurance: Inspecting goods and services at the source of production to remedy any issues before delivery to the customer.\nQuality improvement: Reviewing findings from the preceding stages, defining what improvements are needed, then repeating the quality control management cycle all over again.\nWhat is quality control software?\nQuality control software is a separate category of software tools designed to manage and streamline quality control processes within an organization. From inspections to reporting, to analytics and strategic decision making, quality control management software can establish clear lines of communication among all stakeholders.\nFor example, quality control software solutions are critical in an ISO environment as they provide a whole range of benefits, including transparency, risk mitigation, timely reporting, data analytics, productivity, and cost reduction, positively impacting stakeholders’ investments. What’s more, they help companies streamline essential quality compliance while optimizing product development and production.What is software quality assurance?\nSoftware quality assurance (SQA) ensures all software engineering processes, methods and activities are monitored and comply with internationally defined standards. These standards might be one or a combination of systems, such as ISO 9000, ISO/IEC 15504 or the CMMI model. Throughout the entire software development life cycle, SQA works alongside software development, continually checking for quality issues in each development phase.How does QMS software help your business?\nConducting business with integrity means always striving to improve quality and compliance while being mindful of operational costs. The adoption of QMS tools helps meet these goals, whether that’s across an entire organization or within specific departments such as quality, regulatory or product development.\nIntelligent use of QMS software accelerates product innovation, meets regulatory requirements, increases speed to market and operational excellence while improving customer satisfaction within a smart, adaptable, cloud-based quality management system.\nCompliance with quality standards and regulation is a key part of the QMS remit. Robust quality management software systems support organizations of all sizes in seamlessly and efficiently managing every facet of ISO 9001 across their operations.\n\nISO 9001:2015Quality management systems — RequirementsQMS software trends to watch\nQMS software is dynamic and rapidly evolving. Some of the groundbreaking features that have already launched or are expected to be rolled out in the near future include:\n\nCloud-based solutions for scalability, accessibility and flexibility.\nResponsive design that takes existing mobile apps a step closer to tomorrow’s technology, boosting agility and ease of access.

        "abstract": "Trust makes the world go round. Without it, democracies crumble and relationships suffer. The same goes for organizations and businesses – without the trust of their customer base, they simply cannot succeed.\nTrust, however, is never a given. Like respect, it must be won, and in an ever-evolving business landscape, it is earned through a commitment to consistency, reliability and quality management. Through every step of the process – whether as part of the manufacturing, delivery or consumption of goods and services – there simply is no trust without quality assurance.\nGlobal markets and consumer expectations are rapidly evolving. In this fast-changing landscape, it isn’t always easy to stay ahead of the curve. So how can organizations optimize quality assurance (QA) in our uncertain but increasingly interconnected world?",
        "content": "What is quality assurance?\nIs there a quality assurance definition? In essence, it is a clear and concise framework that embraces every element of the operations of an organization, not least quality management which plays an instrumental role in fostering a culture of constant, ongoing improvement. The QA team is involved in all stages of development: production, testing, packaging and delivery.\nThe primary aim of QA is to reduce the risk of defects – and importantly, to address faults as early as possible in the value chain. This reduces the number of defects which are revealed at the stage of final inspection, when correction becomes difficult and costly. The further upstream a defective element is identified and corrected, thanks to a tightly managed quality assurance system, the less time and energy is wasted, reducing costs and safeguarding brand reputation.\nIn practice, this means putting in place both technical and managerial processes, so as to efficiently monitor and improve product or service quality. A QA system ensures these processes are implemented, including product testing, employee surveys or equipment safety assessments. Once implemented, all these elements will be geared towards maintaining and improving an organization’s quality standards. QA also ensures compliance with industry standards and regulations, gives organizations a competitive edge, and directly contributes to higher profitability.History of QA and QC\nThe concept of quality has been integral to human civilization for millennia, but to understand how these modern QA concepts came into being, it’s useful to explore their evolution over time:\nAncient civilizations and mediaeval guilds\nIn Ancient Greece and Egypt, detailed standards were set for construction and craftsmanship. This emphasis on quality continued through the Middle Ages with the establishment of guilds, which regulated standards within trades. Guild masters inspected goods and required artisans to produce high-quality “masterpieces”, ensuring consistent craftsmanship.\nIndustrial Revolution\nThe rise of factory-based production marked a shift from skilled, verified craftsmanship to standardized methods. Frederick Winslow Taylor’s principles of scientific management introduced efficiency-focused practices, including formal training and strict documentation that laid the groundwork for modern quality assurance.\n1930s and 1940s\nAt Bell Labs, American physicist, engineer and statistician Walter Shewhart advanced quality practices by proposing the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle. His work introduced iterative cycles for enhancing quality and problem solving, which became fundamental to modern quality control, or QC. Building on this, William Edwards Deming, a renowned statistician and quality management expert, applied the PDSA model in post-WWII Japan, significantly boosting manufacturing efficiency and product quality.\nDeming’s contribution to quality assurance has been foundational in shaping modern quality management practices, emphasizing the need for continuous improvement, systematic approaches and a deep understanding of both processes and people.Best practices in quality assurance\nQuality assurance retains its magic when implemented in alignment with a series of best practices, including:\n\nStrong leadership commitment and support\nDetailed quality planning in product design and process development\nComprehensive training on QA principles and procedures\nRigorous process documentation and control\nExtensive collaboration and communication across teams\nOngoing audits and risk assessment\nUse of statistical quality control tools\nValidation of corrective/preventive actions\nContinual measurement and analysis of quality data\nRecognition and replication of best practices\n\nClose adherence to best practices ensures the integration of quality into every step of the value chain, from R&D to procurement, production to distribution – and all the way to post-sales services.\n\nSign up for email updates\nRegister to receive resources and updates on quality management and related standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Subscribe\n\n\n\nAlmost done! \nYou are only one step away from joining the ISO subscriber list.

Let’s look at a hypothetical scenario in which robust QA processes can help a business identify and resolve issues quickly, safeguarding both product quality and customer trust.\nProblem: XYZ Electronics, a company that manufactures and sells wireless headphones, notices a significant uptick in product returns within the first three months of sale. In most cases, this is due to battery issues: either the headphones won’t charge properly or they fail to hold the charge after a short period.\nAction: The QA team conducts an investigation to identify the root cause of the problem. They perform a series of tests on returned products and discover that the batteries in these units degrade more rapidly than expected. Further analysis reveals that the problem began after the company switched to a new battery supplier to reduce costs.\nSolution: The QA team immediately informs senior management of the issue and recommends suspending purchases from the new supplier. To prevent future issues, they introduce a new QA policy that requires a comprehensive life-cycle test for all critical components before approval. The company switches back to the original battery supplier and enhances its incoming quality checks. Additionally, they set up a cross-functional team to monitor new components’ performance for the first six months after any change.Quality assurance methods\nQA typically uses one or more of the following methods to manage and enhance quality:\n\nMaterial testing involves subjecting a product to various conditions to identify its breaking points or potential areas of failure. For physical products, this can include tests under extreme conditions such as heat, pressure or repeated use to gauge durability. In software development, this might involve stress or load testing, where the software is pushed to handle maximum users or data volumes.\nPerformance testing is used to simulate real-world scenarios to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of a product, component or system under specific conditions. This ensures it meets predefined performance criteria such as speed, stability, durability or capacity.\nStatistical process control (SPC) is a data-driven method that uses statistical techniques such as control charts to monitor and control production processes. SPC helps companies detect variations that could lead to defects by analysing data collected during production. This allows for the early identification of trends and potential problems, enabling corrective actions before defects occur.\nTotal quality management (TQM) is an organization-wide approach focused on continuous improvement and customer satisfaction. TQM integrates quality assurance into every aspect of a company’s operations, encouraging all employees to take ownership of quality and constantly seek ways to enhance processes, reduce waste and improve product quality.\n\nThese quality assurance methods ensure products meet high standards of performance, durability and reliability across industries. By applying these techniques, companies can proactively address potential issues, drive continuous improvement and enhance customer satisfaction.Creating a quality assurance plan in six key steps\nA robust plan requires careful planning, design, and a well-executed roll-out. Although the following steps may appear daunting at first glance, organizations typically find that they quickly become part of their operational fabric.\nHere’s a brief rundown:\n\nSharpen your focus: Conduct risk assessments to identify areas that would benefit from QA focus and develop procedures that are aligned with business processes.\nDefine quality objectives: Clear and measurable goals, metrics and performance targets will make the plan much easier to implement.\nRoles and responsibilities: Training staff to detect and repair issues in the early stages of product development is crucial. This hinges upon the availability of easily digestible processes and rules that clearly describe objections and expectations in the day-to-day language of the organization.\nAnalyse the results: Following implementation, it’s time to collect quality data. This will support strategic analysis, action and the review of key performance metrics.\nMake adjustments: After reviewing and reflecting upon feedback, the next step is to revisit original goals, making agreed-upon adjustments. This should be followed by a regular audit every two to three months – or at shorter intervals if needed.\nCelebrate QA successes: If the QA plan has boosted end goals, sales rates or customer satisfaction, let the teams know. Positive feedback anchors employee motivation. This will encourage staff to extend their knowledge of the process and contribute to a culture of operational excellence.\nWhat is the difference between quality assurance and quality control\nWe’ve explored what quality assurance entails, but what is quality control? The terms quality assurance and quality control (QC) are sometimes used interchangeably, but they represent distinct concepts. Here are the essential differences between quality assurance and quality control:\n\nQuality assurance asks: “Are we doing the process right and preventing defects?” It refers to preventive activities to design, document and build quality into processes.\nQuality control asks: “Are we producing the right product and meeting specifications?” It involves more detective work, such as conducting testing and inspection to identify defects and correct them.\n\nIn essence, quality assurance provides the system for quality control activities to take place. An effective quality system integrates both assurance and control to deliver products and services that consistently meet requirements.\nIn a similar fashion, there are important differences between quality assurance and quality management. In quality assurance, only potentially negative influences on the quality of the end product are analysed, and then, at best, eliminated. By contrast, quality management positively focuses on the quality of the product. It’s the ongoing quest to seek better and better. In other words, quality management establishes policies and objectives that improve organizational performance.\nSo, while quality management provides the overarching strategy, quality assurance deploys practices and processes to implement that strategy. Together, these coordinated activities focus on directing and controlling the quest for quality.\n\nISO 9001:2015Quality management systems — RequirementsStandards of quality\nA quality assurance system underscores an organization’s credibility, while also improving work processes and efficiency. ISO is a driving force behind QA practices and mapping the processes used to implement QA.\nQA is often associated with the ISO 9000 family of standards. Many companies use ISO 9001 to ensure that their quality assurance system is in place and effective. ISO&nbsp9001 guidance includes a strong customer focus, top management practices, and how to keep pace with continuing improvement. It also contains practical information for risk-based decision making.Quality assurance: powering success\nIn today’s highly competitive global markets, organizations that make wise investments in QA are reaping the benefits. They mitigate risks, proactively reduce the chances of defects, perform to a consistent standard of quality, build trust among consumers, strengthen their industry position, and excel in crucial business metrics. In short, they embody the hallmarks of a credible, dependable and bankable brand that customers and stakeholders can believe in."

And achieving this goal requires a foundation of sound quality management systems.  \nAn effective quality management system (QMS) provides the means to consistently meet consumer expectations and deliver products and services with minimal waste. In today’s highly competitive global economy, having a QMS in place is the prerequisite for sustainable success.",
        "content": "What is a quality management system? \nIn the most simple terms, a quality management system is a clearly defined set of processes and responsibilities that makes your business run how it’s supposed to. Each organization tailors its own QMS, comprising a formal set of policies, processes and procedures established to elevate consumer satisfaction. A QMS guides organizations as they standardize and enhance quality controls across manufacturing, service delivery and other key business processes. \nThe core benefits of a QMS include: \n\nElevated consistency and standardization of processes and outputs \nReduced errors and increased operational efficiency \nImproved customer satisfaction through the delivery of quality products and services \nContinuous evaluation and improvement of organizational operations \nWhat is a digital QMS? \nA QMS can be delivered digitally rather than using paper checklists and forms. This saves organizations time, mitigates risk and minimizes the chance of human error. Implementing a digital QMS requires meticulous planning and execution, and needs to be designed to comply with relevant regulations and industry standards, incorporating robust digital security measures to protect data. \nAll of these approaches call for expert guidance. Types of quality management systems \nA QMS may be based on either domestic or international standards. Different QMSs respond to different needs and scenarios, and organizations can choose to implement just one, or integrate a blend of different approaches. Among the most common are: \n\nStandardized systems: These set the bar for established standards and agreed-upon codes and practices, such as certifications against ISO standards. ISO 9001 outlines requirements for a comprehensive QMS and provides guidance for organizations looking to implement or improve their quality management strategy. \nTotal quality management (TQM): TQM is a management philosophy centred on customer satisfaction through the active participation of every employee. Its goal is to support the continuous improvement of quality across all levels and business functions. \nLean management: Inefficiencies can result in unnecessary waste. Lean management strives to maximize customer value while minimizing waste using tools like value stream mapping, which helps fine-tune an organization’s processes for optimum efficiency. \nSix Sigma: Although perfection is almost impossible to reach, the pursuit of it is still worthwhile. Six Sigma uses data-driven techniques in the pursuit of producing near-perfect products and services, with a defect rate of 3.4 per one million opportunities. While that’s not perfect, it is pretty close. \n\n\nSign up for email updates\nRegister to receive resources and updates on quality management and related standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Subscribe\n\n\n\nAlmost done! \nYou are only one step away from joining the ISO subscriber list.

It’s about seizing an unprecedented opportunity. As we race to curb emissions, we’re unleashing a tsunami of innovation, creating jobs, and reimagining our relationship with energy. Solar power is proving that we can have our cake and eat it too – sustainability and prosperity, hand in hand.\nReady to catch some rays? Buckle up as we explore the incredible rise of solar energy. From its storied past to its cutting-edge present, we’ll show you why the future looks bright, powered by the greatest energy source in our solar system.",
        "content": "A short history of solar energy\nSolar energy’s story starts in 1767 with Swiss scientist Horace-Bénédict de Saussure, who built the first solar collector – a simple box that captured the sun’s heat. It wasn’t flashy, but it sparked an idea. Fast forward to 1839 when French physicist Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel made a groundbreaking discovery. He found that when light shines on certain materials, it can generate electricity. This laid the groundwork for the solar photovoltaics we rely on today.\nThe real breakthrough, however, came in 1954, when Bell Labs unveiled the first practical solar cell – a silicon cell that had an efficiency of about 6 %. This wasn’t just a scientific leap, it marked the birth of the solar panel. As the space race heated up in the 1950s and 60s, solar technology took centre stage, proving to be the ideal power source for satellites. This kick-started a new era of renewable energy that would eventually reach far beyond space.\nBut it was the 1970s energy crisis that brought solar down to Earth, pushing rapid innovation. Efficiency improved, prices dropped, and the world began to realize that solar energy wasn’t just an option – it was a necessity.What is solar energy?\nInexhaustible on a human scale, our sun supplies the Earth with an endless stream of energy. The challenge is to capture a tiny fraction of this energy to light up our cities, power our homes and fuel our industries. Modern technology has given us two exciting ways to tap into this renewable resource:\n\nPassive solar energy: Think of it as nature’s own thermostat. By strategically positioning buildings to soak up sunlight, you can create cozy, energy-efficient homes. With walls acting like giant batteries, they store the sun’s warmth during the day and release it again at night.\nActive solar energy: This is what comes to mind when we think of solar power – sleek solar panels or solar water heaters transforming sun energy into electricity and heat. The shiny panels do the heavy lifting, converting rays into renewable energy that can power everything from your morning coffee to your evening shower.\n\nBy combining these two approaches, modern solar energy systems can effectively harness and use the sun’s energy, paving the way for a future where our power needs align seamlessly with nature.\n\nSign up for email updates\nRegister for additional resources and updates on energy standards and related topics!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Subscribe\n\n\n\nAlmost done! \nYou are only one step away from joining the ISO subscriber list. Please confirm your subscription by clicking on the email we've just sent to you. You will not be registered until you confirm your subscription.

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nHow does solar energy work?\nWhile most forms of energy can ultimately be traced back to the sun, the term “solar energy” typically refers to techniques that capture sunlight and convert it directly into a usable form of energy. Solar energy systems use three major technologies that tap into the sun’s energy, locally and in large-scale solar farms.\n\nSolar thermal power (for heating): Imagine warming your home with nothing but sunlight. Solar thermal collectors absorb the sun’s rays (solar radiation) and transfer them to a fluid – air, water or antifreeze – which carries that warmth where it is needed, keeping your space cozy and energy-efficient.\nConcentrated solar power (for electricity): Giant “mirrors” concentrate solar radiation to heat a transfer fluid, like molten salt or oil, to a very high temperature. This heat creates steam that spins a turbine, generating clean electricity. It’s like using the sun’s rays to drive a power plant.\nSolar photovoltaics (for electricity): Solar panels instantly convert sunlight to electricity. When light hits the silicon-based photovoltaic cells, it excites electrons, creating direct current (DC). An inverter then converts the DC into alternating current (AC) for use. Multiple cells form a solar panel, and several panels combine to create a solar array.\nSun energy in action\nSolar energy is emerging as a powerful and versatile solution for our energy needs. As the technology advances, its applications are becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives. Let’s explore some of the exciting ways solar is already being used today:\n\nResidential: With solar panel technology, homeowners are harnessing renewable energy to power their lives, transforming rooftops and yards into eco-friendly energy hubs. Best of all, they’re slashing their energy bills in the process.\nCommercial and industrial: Businesses are jumping on the solar bandwagon too. Solar panels allow enterprises to cut operational costs while meeting their sustainability goals – turning once ordinary rooftops into energy assets.\nSolar power plants: Countries worldwide are investing heavily in large-scale solar farms, reducing their reliance on fossil fuels. These installations generate significant electricity from sunlight, cutting greenhouse gas emissions and creating jobs.\nPublic infrastructure: Imagine walking down a solar-powered sidewalk or cruising along solar roads that generate electricity as you drive. As these technologies gain traction, they have the potential to turn our daily commute into dynamic sources of renewable energy.\nFarming: Solar energy is revolutionizing agriculture, transforming how farmers irrigate crops, dry produce and manage livestock in remote areas. It’s not just about feeding the world, it’s about doing so sustainably and responsibly.\nPortable devices: Say goodbye to dead batteries and hello to eco-friendly charging. With solar PV cells embedded in everything from calculators to backpacks, you can harness sun energy wherever life takes you.\nSpace: And let’s not forget the final frontier. Satellites and space stations rely heavily on solar energy. The International Space Station uses arrays of solar panels to harness sunlight, providing a continuous supply of electricity for its systems and equipment as it orbits Earth.\nBenefits and challenges\nExciting applications await, for sure. But before we fully embrace this transition, it’s important to consider the pros and cons of solar energy. Undoubtedly, sun energy is an environmental game changer. It significantly reduces carbon emissions, contributing to cleaner air and a healthier planet. It is also a powerhouse of opportunity, promising job creation, greater price stability and the enticing prospect of long-term energy independence.\nBut let’s keep it real – despite its radiant potential, solar power isn’t without its challenges. The sun’s energy isn’t constant; it varies based on location, time of day, season and weather. These fluctuations keep energy planners busy, constantly seeking innovative solutions to keep the lights on when the clouds roll in.\nAnd then there’s the elephant in the room: cost. While prices have dropped dramatically over the last decade, the initial investment is still a hurdle for many. Ironically, while solar panels herald a cleaner future, they also have a darker side: their production involves toxic materials and energy-intensive processes. As early solar installations near the end of their lifespan, the need for proper recycling will become increasingly critical.The power of standards\nSo, while the potential of solar energy is dazzling, navigating its challenges requires a robust framework to ensure reliability and safety. Enter International Standards – the unsung heroes of the solar industry. In this dynamic landscape of solar energy, these standards are the guiding star, ensuring solar energy systems are not just high-quality, but also safe, efficient and reliable.\nTake the ISO 9459 series. It’s the reason you can trust your solar water heater to deliver that steamy shower, come rain or shine. But that’s not all. The ISO 22975 series takes solar collectors to new heights, ensuring they maintain peak performance and optimal efficiency over time, even in the toughest conditions. These standards do more than just guarantee quality; they are catalysts for innovation, inspiring the industry to break new ground and transform the sun’s potential into a powerful force for change.\n\nISO 9459-4:2013Solar heating — Domestic water heating systems — Part 4: Component tests and computer simulation\n\nISO 9806:2017Solar energy — Solar thermal collectors — Test methods\n\nISO 22975-5:2019Solar energy — Collector components and materials — Part 5: Insulation material durability and performanceWhat’s next for solar energy?\nThe future of sun energy is looking exceptionally bright. Projections suggest that by the end of the decade, we could be manufacturing over 1 200 gigawatts* of solar panels annually. This optimistic outlook is driven by several exciting trends:\n\nTechnological breakthroughs: Innovations like multi-junction and perovskite solar cells are shaking up the solar energy landscape, and it’s easy to see why. While multi-junction cells capture more light per unit area, leading to more energy generation, perovskite cells surpass traditional options in power absorption. Get ready for a future, where a dynamic blend of solar photovoltaic and thermal technologies will pave the way for more efficient and versatile solar power plants.\nEnergy storage: The race is on to advance energy storage solutions, with innovative battery technologies addressing the challenges of intermittent solar power. Meanwhile, smart grid integration is transforming how we manage and coordinate variable renewable energy sources, ensuring a steady flow of energy when we need it most.\nIntegrated photovoltaics: Solar energy is set to become a standard feature of our world, appearing on everything from rooftops to streetlights, to solar-powered wearables. Floating solar power plants on lakes and reservoirs are creatively tackling land scarcity, while solar panels embedded in electric vehicles are extending their range and reducing charging needs.\nPrintable solar technology: Get ready for a game changer! This innovative technology allows solar cells to be produced using flexible materials and manufacturing methods akin to traditional printing. The result? Lightweight, cost-effective solar solutions that can be applied to various surfaces, making solar energy more accessible than ever.\n\n* Source: International Energy Agency (IEA)Powering a brighter future\nWhile it may not be a silver bullet, solar energy represents a golden opportunity to reshape our world. From sun-soaked rooftops to sprawling solar farms, this technology is not just changing how we generate electricity or heat, it’s redefining our entire relationship with energy. But this solar revolution goes far beyond solar panels and power plants – it’s about energy democracy, empowering individuals and communities to generate their own clean electricity. It’s about resilience, creating a decentralized grid that can weather storms and blackouts. But most of all, it’s about hope, illuminating a path forward in our fight against climate change."

        "published_day": "Not specified",
        "abstract": "By Deann Desai,\nProject Manager,\nGeorgia Institute of Technology Energy and Sustainability Services,\nGeorgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership\nLinkedIn\nThe energy sector is at a pivotal crossroads, where technology, innovation and policy converge to create a landscape ripe for transformational change. It’s a moment in time where the potential for real, lasting impact is within reach. Throughout my career, I’ve been fortunate to collaborate with an incredible array of visionary individuals who have continually inspired me.\nIn the early years of my journey, as climate change became an urgent global issue, it was clear to me that energy management wasn’t just a technical necessity, it was a strategic lever for addressing greenhouse gas emissions and driving the energy transition. Today, this challenge is at the heart of boardrooms, investor strategies and corporate communications. For any meaningful shift to take place, every stakeholder must be on board, working together toward a shared goal.\nWe’ve seen profound shifts in response to climate change, especially within the energy sector. But the truth is, we’re only scratching the surface. To fully realize a sustainable, low-emissions future, we need to continue paving the way for a smoother transition, ensuring that businesses, communities and countries alike can all join in this critical transformation.",
        "content": "Making change accessible\nOver the past few years, the sector has made significant and encouraging progress in addressing climate change. National and international policy decisions have catalysed investment in national energy grids across the globe, enabling the reduction of emissions factors in electrical energy – measuring the pollutants released per unit of activity – through increased use of renewable energy and greater grid efficiency. This marks a major step toward reducing the sector’s impact on greenhouse gas emissions.\nAt the same time, energy-intensive industries, including oil and gas, steel, cement, and aviation, have embraced decarbonization technologies at an accelerating pace. Innovations in renewable energy are similarly transforming the landscape of commercial buildings, cities and residential areas, making everyday life more sustainable. Agriculture, which accounts for roughly 22 % of global emissions, remains a significant contributor to climate change. However, the sector is seeing a shift toward more sustainable practices, with renewable energy sources such as biomass, wind, solar and waste being increasingly deployed.\nWhile these advancements in renewable energy and storage technologies have expanded their reach and reduced costs, the challenge now is to make these technologies even more affordable and accessible. Achieving this goal will require the expansion of emissions-reducing initiatives, alongside efforts to lower the costs of updating technologies and infrastructure needed to distribute renewable energy in a way that meets growing global demand.\nInternational Standards can play a pivotal role in overcoming these challenges. By providing a shared framework for organizations, these global standards will be instrumental in scaling up renewable energy adoption, fostering innovation, and ensuring that climate goals are met in an inclusive, efficient and sustainable manner.Engagement is essential\nAs a leading expert in energy management and energy savings, I recognize that one of the foremost challenges we face is stakeholder engagement. In our pursuit of a consensus on standards that address global sustainability and climate resilience goals, it is essential that we broaden the spectrum of viewpoints and involve a diverse range of stakeholders. This can be achieved by leveraging social media to engage individuals on key messages related to the energy transition. Such dialogue will not only inform our work but also provide valuable insights into how we can better support our global community.\nEqually important is the need to harness new technologies to enhance the standards development process and improve the way users interact with these standards. More critically, we must engage the next generation of standards developers to ensure that we are not just shaping a current consensus, but laying the groundwork for standards that will continue to serve and benefit our members for years to come.\nLooking ahead, the next five years will be pivotal. The transition away from fossil fuels must be managed in a way that ensures financial viability for economies, businesses and individual energy consumers. For the energy transition to succeed, it must be inclusive and equitable – this is not only a technical challenge but an economic one as well.\nThe energy transition is undeniably central to global efforts to combat climate change, yet translating national policies into tangible, everyday actions within businesses remains a significant challenge. This is where ISO standards can play a transformative role. By offering clear frameworks and guidance, ISO standards help bridge the gap between policy and practice, ensuring that organizations are equipped to contribute meaningfully to the energy transition while navigating its complex technical and economic dimensions.Paving the way\nISO is uniquely positioned to guide organizations through the complexities of change, offering the tools and frameworks necessary for informed decision-making at every stage of the energy transition journey. Our standards provide a clear pathway for organizations to understand and take meaningful action in reducing energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, ensuring they remain aligned with both their specific needs and broader sustainability goals.\nBut ISO’s impact extends beyond industry. We are equally equipped to engage with policymakers, urging them to take bold, decisive actions that will help achieve the global objective of limiting temperature increases to below 1.5 °C. In parallel, our companion standards on assurance play a crucial role by enabling organizations to provide transparent, reliable information on their emission reduction efforts – an essential step in building trust and credibility with consumers.\nI firmly believe that the global energy transition must permeate all aspects of our energy production and consumption, ultimately influencing every sector of the economy. While this process can seem complex and, at times, daunting, International Standards serve as a vital enabler, facilitating the adoption of common systems that simplify this transition. ISO offers a comprehensive suite of standards across more than 300 technical areas, ensuring that every aspect of an organization’s energy needs is addressed. By supporting the energy sector in navigating this transition with clarity and confidence, ISO plays a crucial role in advancing our collective goals – especially the imperative to combat climate change and protect the future of our planet."

        "published_day": "Not specified",
        "abstract": "Authored by the leadership of ISO/TC 309, recipient of the LDE Award 2024:\n\nKevin Brear, Chair \nDr Axel Kravatzky, Vice-Chair \nMike Henigan, Committee Manager \n\n\n \n\n\nToday, we stand in a world full of peril and potential in equal measure. Artificial intelligence (AI) has propelled us into a new era of technology and given rise to questions about what’s next. Across countries, we see deepening social and political divisions developing in parallel with rising temperatures in a rapidly warming world.\n\n\nSimultaneously, we have never been so connected to other countries and to each other. We are all in this together. There is a shared sense of urgency to act on global challenges, and we have more powerful technology than ever to deploy against today’s social and economic issues.\nHarnessing these opportunities to meet the challenges before us hinges on two things: our commitment to purpose and our ability to act on that purpose. Good governance empowers us to conquer on both fronts.\nWeak governance can undermine trust in organizations, damage reputations, incur heavy financial losses and lead to painful legal repercussions. But most importantly, poor governance prevents us from achieving the positive outcomes we so need: the wellbeing of people and planet. Good governance gives shape to an organization’s purpose and defines the contours of the value that organizations can generate. It enables that same organization to actively oversee – and course correct, if needed – its progress towards that purpose.\nFinally, with good governance comes accountability. This not only lays out good delegation systems where responsibilities can be distributed effectively and strategically. Accountability holds organizations responsible to those experiencing the consequences of their actions – positive or negative – and to stakeholders who want organizations to be aligned with their expectations throughout the journey.",
        "content": "Defining good governance as a global priority\nWe’re seeing a growing awareness of the importance of good governance, with issues spilling out of the secrecy of the boardroom and into public discourse. Our collective concern with governance is reflected in headlines about billion-dollar safety scandals, boycott movements to call out opaque financial practices and demand transparency, and a cultural expectation for products to do good as well as be good.\nBut with organizations operating across a spectrum of sizes, sectors, cultures and aims, how can we agree on a shared definition of good governing practices? And what yardstick can we use to measure an organization’s leadership? This is where International Standards come in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefining an ultimate purpose\nAt the backbone of International Standard ISO 37000 is the principle that all organizations should define their purpose: the ultimate value they create. For too long, organizational leadership has been judged primarily by financial results. Therefore, it follows that an organization’s purpose has tended to align with financial objectives. It is time for organizations to go beyond finances and start actively contributing to environmental and social welfare. Whether it‘s combatting climate change, supporting local communities or addressing social inequalities, an organization’s work needs to ultimately transcend revenue generation; it needs to also be a force for positive change.\nThrough its 58 participating members and 27 observing members, ISO/TC&nbsp309 – our technical committee – provides guidance on anti-bribery, corruption, whistleblowing and fraud controls, for example. This empowers organizations to avoid doing business with bad people and bad companies. But our standards also touch on internal investigations, conflicts of interest, human trafficking, modern slavery and diversity management.\nGovernance also touches on the ESG framework. While the G in ESG stands for “governance”, this mainly refers to business conduct. Good governance goes beyond this to integrate all silos enveloped in responsible management practices. It therefore governs the entire ESG framework as well as organizational performance and purpose.\nTo build a better future, the ultimate measure of an organization needs to move from profit to include actively working for people and the planet. The idea isn’t that every company does everything. Every decision made will naturally incur a mix of positive and negative outcomes on the factors that constitute value – financial, human, social, natural capital, etc. There will inherently be judgement calls to make and trade-offs to consider. This is why stakeholder engagement, a thorough understanding of sustainability thresholds and accountability are fundamental to good governance. With those three elements in place, every organization can navigate these decisions and optimize for their purpose.Purpose backed by appropriate and proportional action\nA well-defined purpose goes far beyond building positive workplace cultures or setting ambitious environmental targets. It acts as a North Star for decision-making, ensuring every choice aligns with the organization’s ultimate positive contribution. Crucially, it helps leaders and decision makers navigate lean times and judge their situation with foresight and perspective.\nAchieving this purpose ultimately boils down to implementing systems by which an organization is directed, overseen and held accountable for achieving its defined purpose. Because good governance is about more than acting on purpose, it’s about acting appropriately and proportionally to deliver responsible outcomes.\nWe created ISO 37000 to provide guidance on how organizations can do this. Using the expertise of a committee with experience across countries and sectors, it equips governing bodies and governing groups with the tools they need to meet their responsibilities, so that the organizations they govern can fulfil their purpose.\nPertaining directly to the oversight element, ISO 37001, ISO 37002 and ISO 37301 support organizations with anti-bribery, compliance and whistleblowing management systems. This specifically equips organizations with the required tools to build effective internal control systems, reporting mechanisms, audits, and to apply appropriate corrective measures. But governance and integrity have also been adopted as key principles in other standards covering security, resilience and crisis management.\nMore than helping organizations themselves, these International Standards also give governing bodies assurance through guidance on internal and external audits, direct internal reporting and whistleblowing protocols. This gives them and other stakeholders assurance about the reliability of reporting, the effectiveness of internal controls and governance as a whole.A shift in thinking\nGood governance requires a significant cultural and philosophical shift. It is not a matter of quarterly meetings or annual reports, but a commitment to ongoing vigilance across compliance, risk management and integrated management. In many cases, it demands us to interrogate our own assumptions of success, and re-evaluate which companies and leaders we most admire, and why.\nBut with a shared understanding that we are barrelling down an unsustainable economic pathway, and a growing global feeling that crises are multiplying, this shift to prioritizing good governance is not only necessary, but long overdue. As we look to the future, the governance of organizations will remain a critical determinant of success and sustainability.\nWe are wholeheartedly convinced that our work in establishing and promoting governance standards is essential for building resilient organizations capable of adapting to change and leading in their respective fields. Our International Standards will not only be key to unlocking the full potential of organizations, they will help people and planet achieve sustainable growth in the years to come."

        "published_day": "Not specified",
        "abstract": "By Diana Maria Quimbay Valencia,\nCountry Director, Rainforest Alliance\nLinkedIn\nThe climate crisis sits at the very top of the global policy agenda today. From decarbonization to the reduction of plastic pollution and the protection of natural resources, the urgency of the task rings loud and clear. The time to act is now.\nIn spite of this, global climate action suffers from an imbalance between adaptation and mitigation. Climate mitigation seeks to reduce the harmful impact of climate change by cutting emissions and transitioning to a more sustainable world. Climate adaptation, on the other hand, means empowering people and communities to build resilience to the impacts of climate change today. In essence, it refers to measures like building flood walls, diversifying crops and implementing early warning systems against acute climate shocks.\nCurrently, climate mitigation is receiving the majority of funding and is the central focus of policy discussions. However, as the impacts of climate change intensify, we must also enhance adaptation measures and increase the resilience of producers, communities, and landscapes. Through robust frameworks and a fair and just climate finance strategy, we can cope with climate change more effectively and put the world on a more sustainable trajectory.",
        "content": "Better tools for vulnerable farmers\nFarmers in Central and South America (and across the world) are already dealing with the effects of climate change: shorter growing seasons, unpredictable rainfall, a surge in plant diseases and pests, and reduced crop yields. Without bold climate action, crops like coffee and bananas could become rare delicacies in the future. The livelihoods and wellbeing of farming communities are also very much in jeopardy. To build resilience, it is crucial to focus on the most vulnerable populations. Small-holder farmers, especially women, ethnic minorities, and those with limited access to resources, face disproportionate impacts from climate change and often have limited means to cope with its effects.\nThe Rainforest Alliance was founded over 37 years ago with the goal of combating deforestation, strengthening biodiversity, and promoting good agricultural practices. Among our global objectives, we listen to farmers and forest communities’ needs and support them with resilient natural solutions to adapt to climate change. This involves identifying and understanding climate risks and vulnerability levels, and developing and implementing adaptation strategies tailored to the specific needs of the most vulnerable groups, ensuring they are not left behind.\nEmpowering farmers with knowledge, tools, and resources to adapt to changing environmental conditions can help them become more resilient. To this end, we implement strategies for regenerative and climate-smart agriculture, agroforestry, community-based forest management and forest restoration, where farmers can learn sustainable techniques that enhance productivity and reduce environmental impacts, such as transitioning to organic fertilisers, from toxic to approved pesticides and chemical inputs, adopting regenerative and soil conservation practices, and using renewable energy sources, among others.\nOn the other hand, we understand that the journey toward sustainability is complex and demanding, which is why we advocate for shared responsibility in agriculture supply chains. We encourage consumers to recognize the producers’ commitment to sustainability when purchasing certified Rainforest Alliance products. Embracing shared responsibility is essential for fostering a sense of collective engagement where we are all in and for realizing that sustainable practices and collaborative efforts are the only way to safeguard our environment.A joint commitment\nWe strongly believe in the power of alliances. When tackling complex problems, collaboration can make all the difference. By forging a powerful alliance between companies, local communities, regional and international organizations, governments, donors and other stakeholders, we amplify the efforts of those who live and work in the world’s most critical rural communities. Our Integrated Landscape Management (ILM) is a great illustration of how joint action from all landscape actors – farmers, forestry companies, rural communities, local leaders, businesses, and governments – addresses challenges that would be difficult to tackle individually.\nTherefore, having an integrated data system for all our programmes – from certification to landscape interventions – allows us to create more opportunities for greater impact and transparency. Having robust and accurate data enables us to provide high-quality services in the implementation of resilient and sustainable agricultural practices.\nISO, like Rainforest Alliance, seeks to provide solutions to global challenges such as climate change adaptation through alliances and the power of bringing together various stakeholders. Among the many ISO standards related to climate change, GHG reduction, vulnerability and adaptation, the primary interest is to have an appropriate international framework for implementing clear adaptation strategies.\nThe assurance system in the Rainforest Alliance’s certification programme was built on ISO standards. ISO/IEC 17065 is our benchmark for Certificate Bodies accreditation and ISO 19011 guidelines help us define some of the competencies we require of auditors conducting Rainforest Alliance audits. Because ISO 19011 includes the environmental management systems (ISO&nbsp14001), we are also able to say that our Certificate Holders are taking measures to strengthen their climate resilience, including adaptation measures.\nThese ISO standards have become a reference point for public entities, the private sector, organizations and communities alike. Adopting the same language, objectives and definitions and incorporating them into their own strategies and processes will foster trust, transparency and accountability. Ultimately, partnerships built on trust will enable us to make deep-rooted change on some of the most pressing social and environmental issues of our time.\nClimate change adaptation is not just an urgent environmental issue but a fundamental component of sustainable development. By investing and acting now on climate change adaptation, we can foster resilient agricultural systems, support small farmers, and promote long-term economic stability."

        "published_day": "Not specified",
        "abstract": "By Laura Velásquez Herrera,\nPresident and Co-Founder of Arkangel AI\nLinkedIn\nWith its roots in compassion and humanity, the healthcare sector might seem an unlikely place for artificial intelligence (AI) to play a big role. Yet as we look deeper into the complex processes that build our medical systems, we uncover a multitude of ways that AI could revolutionize patient care for better diagnoses.\nThis technology is already impacting healthcare in powerful ways. AI is supporting the detection of conditions like heart disease, rare diseases and cancer. But it is also streamlining administrative tasks like writing summaries and notes, freeing doctors from the burden of paperwork. This empowers them to spend more time and energy on what matters most: their patients.\nAs we continue to adopt and develop AI in healthcare, it is crucial we keep patients at the core of everything we do. When we co-founded Arkangel AI, an AI-powered platform focused on enhancing healthcare services, we were driven to empower providers to keep the human element at the forefront of their industry. With the unprecedented power of AI at our fingertips, we have a responsibility to create scalable solutions that meaningfully address global health challenges. We can’t fall into the trap of creating technology for technology’s sake. For instance, a cancer prediction algorithm is only truly impactful if it’s accessible to people and patients worldwide. To fully realize AI’s benefits, we must not only develop technology, but ensure it’s widely available.",
        "content": "Barriers to AI in healthcare\nIn our experience, there are three major barriers that prevent AI from reaching its full potential in the healthcare sector.\nThe first is that most healthcare practitioners are not well versed in the ins and outs of technology and data management. There is a significant need for education around what technology is used for. Their expertise and focus is rightfully centred on the patients in front of them. AI experts need to work with decision-makers and practitioners themselves to help them understand how and where AI can help them, and build supportive infrastructure allowing them to use tools effectively, without impacting the time and energy they have for patients.\nThe second point is the lack of understanding of the actual problems that need to be solved. Without this, providers cannot determine where and how AI technology can deliver meaningful value. After that, it’s about seeing if there is data to solve that problem. Yes, there is a lot of data today, but it’s not always usable. However, there are always ways to find solutions as long as goals are clear and actionable.\nThe third and perhaps thorniest barrier is a lack of insight into the inaccessibility of healthcare in many parts of the world. Today, over half of the world’s population does not have access to healthcare services. AI can help enhance and expand essential healthcare coverage in low-access areas. In rural Latin America, for example, Arkangel AI is helping to create models that adapt to the basic infrastructure and capabilities available to healthcare professionals. This is helping reach people who don’t have access to specialist providers like radiologists, but it is also enabling early detection of diseases like malaria or the prediction of dengue to take preventive actions and reduce excessive contagion.\nFor patients to experience truly positive outcomes, healthcare institutions and governments must fix the underlying issues in their systems. This means taking a clear-eyed look focusing on the needs and demands of people. Designing AI tools that can only be implemented by a few – for a few – only risks widening the gap in healthcare inequality.Better processes, more compassionate care\nEven with these formidable barriers in mind, the potential of AI to improve the patient experience, and their prognosis, is too promising to disregard.\nToday’s healthcare system is overburdened: too many patients, too few practitioners, too much paperwork, too little budget. In the hands of experienced administrators and practitioners, AI tools allow healthcare systems to alleviate the strain on practitioners, increase efficiency and reduce costs. In this way, AI has the potential to make healthcare more accessible and deliver more impact.\nBut to achieve this, AI algorithms need to be ethical, usable and scalable. With digital healthcare data being highly sensitive, we must ensure we have a common understanding of what functional, accessible AI systems need and how to respectfully and responsibly build systems that work.\nInternational Standards like those developed by ISO will be vital as we undertake this important work. From data sanitation to protection, International Standards like ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27040 can help ensure that healthcare providers are on top of their data collection and that they can feed relevant, healthy and secured data to AI tools.\nInternational Standards can be a game-changer in tackling global disparities in data collection, storage and use. By setting uniform guidelines and offering crucial tools, these standards empower healthcare providers to progress on their digital data journey. Widespread adoption of ISO standards could create a strong data foundation, enabling AI tools to create more impact for more people.\nBy prioritizing standards and ethics and working collaboratively, we can build a healthcare ecosystem where AI acts as a powerful assistant to physicians, improving patient outcomes, increasing efficiency, and reducing costs. With clear guidelines and a steadfast focus on patient welfare, AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare and save lives."

        "abstract": "By Cynthia Hansen,\nManaging Director of the Innovation Foundation, The Adecco Group\nLinkedIn\nWhile our differences are often unspoken and unseen, they are a key ingredient in what drives us forward. Recently, the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) decided to remove equity from its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) definition. This was a strategic decision that aligns with SHRM’s commitment to accelerating holistic change through inclusion.\nLike many HR professionals, I was taken aback by this decision. Equity is a fundamental pillar of creating fair and inclusive workplaces. It is about levelling the playing field of difference, not creating sameness. There is no diversity without difference. It is diversity in its fullest sense that drives creative conflict, that challenges assumptions, and feeds innovation. In other words, without equity we cannot unlock the potential that lies within our differences.\nWhen underpinned by International Standards and driven by companies looking to create a fulfilling environment, HR policies can shape the future of inclusive workspaces.",
        "content": "Action beyond quotas\nThere are many studies that have qualified and quantified the value of diverse teams, from claiming higher rates of productivity to increased market share. I think this is the wrong focus. Typically, the takeaway from these studies is that companies should hire more diverse talent out of the same traditional talent pools. While this might work for a limited time, it has diminishing returns.\nWhat actually matters is that employers start to look beyond quotas, beyond mandates, and to take a more experimental approach to configuring diverse teams and seeing what yields good results. This means opening doors to unconventional pools of talent, valuing a broad range of experience and creating an enabling environment for everyone.\nIn the Women Back to Work programme, the Innovation Foundation is creating ways for mid- and low-skilled women to re-enter work after a career break. It is mainly aimed at non-traditional candidates who often get screened out of hiring processes too early. One of these women, Gabriela, has broad-based skills in customer service, but has never worked in hospitality. The lack of that specific entry in her CV gets her screened out in the first round.\nWhile she is left frustrated by another failed application from which she receives no feedback, it is actually the employer who has lost out on her talent. They lose out on Gabriela’s experience in retail, which gives her skills to work with the public. They overlook Gabriela’s experience setting up her own catering service and expertise in building a business from scratch. They ignore Gabriela’s ability to forge relationships and galvanize a team with her empathy and mentoring skills.Standardizing diversity, equity and inclusion action\nSo, how do we keep people like Gabriela in the system and get them in front of an employer who can see the skills they bring to the table? This all sounds good on paper, but it is much harder in reality. Changing norms and behaviours is immensely difficult. While data may change minds, it is only part of the equation. Hearts need to change as well.\nThe combination of data and empathy may be enough to change the behaviour of an individual recruiter, changing an entire system will take much more. This requires new systems and processes, incentives and rules, examples and narratives. It must rely on a critical mass of employers shifting approaches and sharing their learnings so templates can emerge that lower the threshold for replication.\nThis is where standardization can play a crucial role. By designing and codifying successful models and creating the right mix of accountability and incentives, standardization can push these models into the mainstream. At that point, they cease being an experiment and become table stakes. ISO’s technical committee on human resource management designs International Standards that do exactly this. ISO&nbsp30415, for example, provides comprehensive guidelines for developing, implementing and managing diversity and inclusion in organizations.\nRecognizing that each organization is different, this standard presents the fundamental prerequisites for diversity and inclusion, recommended actions, the relevant responsibilities and potential policy outcomes. Companies can also make an impact at the very first encounter with their workers. Employers with an eye on fair and inclusive recruitment and keen to create a positive candidate experience, can lean on the best practices outlined by ISO 30405.\nBut creating enabling environments doesn’t stop at DE&I and recruitment. International Standards like ISO 45001 focus on occupational health and safety while ISO 45003 empowers organizations to manage psychological risks in the workplace. After all, a workplace cannot be inclusive if it is unsafe and unsupportive of workers’ mental wellbeing.Bridging differences\nEquity is about levelling the playing field, but International Standards allow us to define what the level should be. If everyone is on a universally agreed common baseline, there is only one direction to go: up. If HR teams, hiring managers and employees can collectively shape the future of inclusive workplaces, we can envision a future where skills are weighted alongside certifications, where lived experience is valued as a complement to traditional education and where trainability and learnability are the primary stock in trade. Even a fraction of that is a future I would like to see. For Gabriela. And for all those who struggle in similar situations."

        "abstract": "Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB)\nLinkedIn\nThe world is full of colour and energy. Human ingenuity has harnessed this vibrancy to build truly amazing things. It is also this ingenuity that drives us to perpetually innovate and create, shaping the future we will all inhabit. But for us to make progress on challenges – from renewable power to healthcare – we need a consistent system for measurements.\nMetrology is an invisible foundation for quality of life. The science of measurements establishes and maintains a common framework of definitions which we can all use. It links all human activity and is powered by a continuous cycle of accuracy that drives science and technology forward. Most recently, in 2019, member states of the Metre Convention revised the International System of Units (SI) to redefine four of the seven base units – the kilogramme, ampere, kelvin and mole – in terms of constants that describe the natural world. The kilogramme, for example, has since been defined in terms of the Planck constant.\nWe are the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany’s national metrology institute. From clean water to photovoltaics, we are always looking for accuracy and precision in measurement. Under the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, we deliver services to the public sector and industry on all questions regarding reliable measurements. Besides, we are proud to have played a key role in development cooperation for the past 60 years. Alongside our partner countries, we advise governments, promote institutions and support small and medium-sized enterprises. The projects we implement are funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nWhile much of our scientific work is based on the SI units and their dissemination, our work in the realm of development cooperation encompasses other dimensions. There, our efforts pertain mainly to the measuring and development of an arguably more abstract characteristic: quality.",
        "content": "An international quality infrastructure\nWe know that quality can be measured. Its features are measurable and can be clearly defined. Most importantly, in our view, metrology is built on the heartfelt conviction that quality is a public good. But proving compliance of products and services with national and international specifications requires a consistent network, known as quality infrastructure.\nThis internationally recognized quality infrastructure helps protect consumers and the environment, grow the global economy, combat poverty and unemployment and improve social performance. Because, in practice, quality underpins everything from the filling quantities of prepackaged goods like tuna or toothpaste to the protection of healthy competition in the open market.\nThe quality infrastructure is built on five key pillars: standardization, metrology, conformity assessment, accreditation and market surveillance. By complying and subscribing to such a universal quality framework, organizations – regardless of their size, industry sector and location – are held accountable. This fosters a culture of transparency, clarity and trust in international trade and cross-sector partnerships. The same applies to countries: once they have developed a functional quality infrastructure, they can better integrate into global value chains, thereby boosting their economies.\nDefining quality, however, is an impossible task without clarity on how to measure it. It’s vital that we make sure the measurements we all use are accurate and as future-proof as possible, so they are ready to accommodate future advances in science and technology.From measurements to meaningful impact\nOur work in international cooperation goes beyond measuring and defining quality. We aim to deliver tangible, real-world benefits. For metrology to have a truly meaningful and long-lasting impact, it must be woven into the day-to-day lives of people. For instance, as developed countries around the world look to shift their transportation systems towards electric vehicles, it is essential that charging stations are checked correctly and regularly so that consumers can rely on the accuracy of their top-ups. Just like drivers had to agree on what a litre or a gallon of fuel represented, EV owners will need to know exactly how much power they’re charging into their batteries.\nIn the developing world, our efforts to integrate emerging economies into the global quality infrastructure must answer several key questions. What are the quality-related strengths and weaknesses of the partner countries? What are the demands of users of quality services, such as industry and consumers? What resources and systems can we leverage? How can we make results sustainable in the long term?\nTo be truly effective in “real life”, our cooperation initiatives must marry global consensus and tailor-made solutions specific to unique contexts. There is no room for a one-size-fits-all approach in our search for accuracy. For instance, merchants in some local markets in Sub-Saharan Africa still measure volumes of rice with tin cans – which is what best fits their context. In that case, our mission isn’t to replace a functioning system. Rather, we try to find those actors, cases and products that have the potential to foster economic growth or a safer environment by improving their quality. This empowers them to participate in the global trade network. Not by lowering barriers to access, but by providing the tools necessary to “plug in” to the internationally recognized quality infrastructure.Collaborating for quality\nMetrology and standardization are both integral ingredients of the quality infrastructure. So, the simple fact is that this infrastructure cannot function without International Standards. In that light, international organizations like ISO, as well as national standards bodies like DIN, are obvious and necessary cooperation partners for us. Standards such as ISO 17025, for example, support us in the testing and calibration of instruments in metrology laboratories. Others like ISO 17020 specify requirements for the competence, impartiality and consistency of organizations performing inspections.\nA new topic is the circular economy: in Colombia, we are supporting our partners in the development of a product standard for “black slag”, a by-product of steel production. Together with key stakeholders from quality infrastructure and the industry, slag parameters are being defined and measurement methods are being further developed so that the slag can be transformed from a by-product into a “raw material”, e.g. for road construction. We also support the national standardization institutes in their work on the ISO technical committee on circular economy (ISO/TC 323).\nOn a higher level, PTB and ISO have been cooperating towards sustainable development for many years across the globe through common training measures, awareness creation activities and events – especially through the Capacity Building team. The recent Standards Engage! project, for example, had two main objectives: to increase effective stakeholder engagement in the standardization work of national standards bodies; and to enhance the recognition of the value and benefit of standards by public- and private-sector stakeholders in developing countries.\nIt is a luxury to have no grey areas. At PTB, our mission is to make that luxury a common good. But for this to happen, we must stay true to what is true. Together, metrology and standardization contribute to an internationally recognized quality infrastructure that fosters sustainable economic, social and ecological development. Weaving it into the foundations of the modern world benefits everyone, everywhere."

        "abstract": "By Touradj Ebrahimi,\nEPFL Professor, Founder RayShaper SA and JPEG Convenor (chairman)\nLinkedIn\nFor the last 30 years, the JPEG image format has been a staple for the Internet’s billions of users. While the technologies used to display images have evolved tremendously over the past few decades, the JPEG format is still used everywhere today. This is a great example of what can happen when a new technology develops under consensus-based, responsive and inclusive governance.",
        "content": "Today, we have a chance to do this again. Artificial intelligence (AI) isn’t the first technology to impact day-to-day life for people all over the world, and it certainly won’t be the last. As a university professor, the founder of a company and a longstanding leader in international standards development, I have a fortunate vantage point. My many hats allow me to view the current applications of AI and its promise. To me, there is no doubt that responsible governance is the only way to deliver on the potential of AI while avoiding its negative side effects.  \nThat governance must encompass education, technology and regulation. But most importantly, it must be founded on inclusive and reliable International Standards. Governing the future \nSome liken AI to social media, which also fundamentally changed the way we communicate and connect with each other. Just like social media, AI could create a host of opportunities for positive developments; but it would be foolish to pretend there are no drawbacks. \nI prefer to equate AI to cars, because they are a perfect illustration of how ground-breaking technology can be used positively with responsible governance. People need a licence to legally drive a car, which is obtained through training; cars are significantly safer and easier to use than they used to be thanks to technological progress; and the industry is heavily regulated across the world. History shows that effective and responsible governance must be built on those three blocks. \nThe same applies for AI. First, we need education. People must be informed on the potential risks they face while using AI technologies, and how to avoid them. This way, consumers can actively contribute towards their own safety. \nSecond, there must be technological solutions to counteract risks. Solutions already exist for threats like misinformation, but we must do more to create effective antidotes to AI’s risks.  \nFinally, we need regulation, but we need to be careful in what we regulate. AI technologies and the tools that use them are very complex and move fast. Regulation must be designed and implemented with enough foresight so that it is still relevant by the time it comes into effect. Creating these smart frameworks and umbrellas is challenging work, but it is pivotal to the responsible use of AI going forward. Connecting streams \nThe main challenge is that AI is currently evolving along many tracks, at different speeds. But the challenges and potential risks of AI are global. This calls for inclusive, fair and flexible solutions. To bring all of these streams together and move forward responsibly, we must gather all stakeholders from all over the world around the same table. \nThe private sector - driven by shareholder value and competition - is innovating faster than anyone else. This means they are effectively setting standards as they go, simply because they are the first to wade into unknown territory. This is not negative per se, but it leaves out many key voices from the debate. Scientists, engineers, consumer associations, governments and others must all weigh in and come together to establish the mechanisms needed to guide AI towards a benign and prosperous future. \nISO has a proven track record of doing exactly this, and ISO/IEC 42001 is evidence that AI is high on ISO’s agenda today. As the world’s first AI management system standard, ISO/IEC 42001 addresses the unique challenges AI poses, such as ethical considerations, transparency, and continuous learning. All of this is entities providing or utilizing AI-based products or services, ensuring responsible development and use of AI systems. \nBy taking into account all voices, ISO consistently works towards building International Standards that are inclusive and, most importantly, flexible. From the humble JPEG to global telephone networks and broadcasting systems, many of today’s technologies would not have been possible without standards. \nWe stand on the brink of a new world powered by AI technologies. This provides an opportunity to minimize global risks by listening to all voices equally. To deliver on the promise of AI, we must act fast. Being static is not an option."
