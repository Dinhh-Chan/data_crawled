The Cancun Climate Change Agreements of 2010\\u00a0called on developed countries to jointly \\u201cmobilize\\u201d USD\\u00a0100\\u00a0billion annually by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. While this might seem a commendable goal, the world\\u2019s first-ever global stocktake at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP28) in December 2023 showed that both financial contributions and mitigation efforts are far from meeting commitments.\\nThe more we wait, the higher the costs, both in terms of mitigating global temperature rise and coping with its impacts.
