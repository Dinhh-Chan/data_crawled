This indispensable software application runs on individual user’s PC and requires neither network nor Internet connection.  It is limited to the scope and boundaries of Article 5 of the Radio Regulations and is the perfect complement to the Radio Regulations (Edition 2024) that incorporates the decisions of the 2023 World Radiocommunication Conference.\nBuilt around a relational database model, the software is equipped with various tools and utilities that allow, among others, for exporting data to various formats, as well as for the tracing and comparison of the evolution of the Article 5 Table and its associated footnotes (from the 2001 Edition onward). Ultimately, the software provides for the extraction and modification of the National Table of Frequency Allocations for a given geographic area (country), based on the corresponding “International Plan” which results after combining the information contained in Article 5 of the Radio Regulations.\nUpon purchase and download of the software, you will be prompted to request a license — on up to 3 separate personal devices — prior to using the software. To upgrade to a 2-10 or organizational-wide license, please contact ITU Sales, separately.    For any technical questions or support, post-purchase, please email BR Tools Tech Support .\n2024 edition available:  5 October 2024\n\n"

Other challenges include increasing volumes of e-waste, competition with the informal sector, absence of an established regulatory framework (in development), and lack of financial investments. Namibia has ratified several international and regional conventions and agreements related to environmental management, which are also of relevance for e-waste. Namibia must establish integrated waste management infrastructure for the collection and dismantling of e-waste backed by technical standards and guidelines, and construct new or repurpose existing waste drop-off, pre-treatment, dismantling, and disposal sites.

An analysis within the Policy identified e-waste as one of the fastest growing waste streams in Botswana, along with several other issues and challenges regarding e-waste in Botswana. Botswana has ratified several international and regional conventions and agreements related to environmental management, which are also of relevance for e-waste. Botswana has some companies actively dealing with e-waste, but the available infrastructure is insufficient to handle e-waste and the licensed companies are not specialized in this sector.

In addition, the sector’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions rival those of the aviation industry, and its energy requirements often impose pressure on resources. Therefore, the pressing global challenge lies in closing the connectivity gap and leveraging digital technologies for climate action in an environmentally sustainable manner.\n\n"

The joint ITU-UNEP-UNITAR Regional E-waste Monitor for the Western Balkans collects internationally comparable e-waste statistics in the region. This report delves into the characteristics of this increase, such as technological innovations and a growing middle class. Offering factual insights, it meticulously analyzes statistics, key stakeholders, current policies, legislation, technological practices, and societal interdependencies. The report not only highlights the challenges but provides recommendations to address the E-waste issue effectively.\n\nNotably, the region has experienced a 67% increase in E-waste generation since 2010, reaching 0.15 Mt in 2021, with a collection rate at 27%. Despite specific legislation and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes in place, challenges persist, including incomplete EPR implementation and inadequate infrastructure. The report’s six recommendations advocate for preventative measures, awareness, enhanced collection, improved treatment, safety measures, fair compensation, and increased training to foster a holistic approach across all stakeholders in the region. This report aims to guide policymakers, industries, and communities toward sustainable E-waste management practices.\n\n"

Complementary actions can be wide in scope, from commercially or not-for-profit driven to solution-based actions, including deposit-return or refund schemes, public-private-partnerships, as well as the all-actors-approach and the best-of-two worlds philosophy.

This is achieved by (re)creating audio-visual realities and allowing the user to naturally interact with these virtual environments.\n\nThis ITU-R Report is intended to describe a brief technical background and important definitions used for AIAV systems, use cases for broadcasting of AIAV programme material, and other challenges that have emerged through those production trials.\n\n"

Through a clustering methodology these dimensions are also presented graphically. Based on this, the most prominent requirements of each case can easily be extracted, and their accumulated statistics are further shown to provide future network designers with a high-level perspective of the diverse dimensions foreseen as requirements of future use cases.\n\n"

Addressing five categories of laws that address DLT systems, the paper continues to show how policy-makers can implement a legal framework that effectively governs the features and use cases of the technology. Categories of laws explored include legislation addressing DLT systems such as code and intellectual property; governance; DLT use cases such as crypto-currency, tokenomics, anti-money laundering and privacy, and consumer law; civil liability and consortia; and legislation that addresses the different layers of DLT structures. The aim is to give policy-makers the tools to manage civil and criminal liability, control management supervision of network participants, provide authoritative sources of data, make DLT records “legal proof,” and protect personal data and make it compatible with existing regulations.\n\n"

It is an open standard, meaning it is non-proprietary, platform-independent, and perpetual royalty-free.\n\nAlthough it is a new standard, it builds on a rich set of proven-working and widely-adopted open standards, such as the Web protocols and the OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards, including the ISO/OGC Observation and Measurement data model [OGC 10-004r3 and ISO 19156:2011]. That also means the sensorThings API is extensible and can be applied to not only simple but also complex use cases.\n\nThis report provides a standard way to manage and retrieve observations and metadata from heterogeneous IoT sensor systems. It follows the REST principles, the use of an efficient JSON encoding, the use of MQTT protocol, the use of the flexible OASIS OData protocol and URL conventions.\n\n"

Digital Identity in the ICT Ecosystem: An Overview presents an overview of the challenges and opportunities involved in securing digital identities that cannot be compromised. It details a plan for the one billion connected people worldwide to establish a digital identity and how governments can protect that identity so that the world’s citizens can trust the technology they use every day in a number of ways.\n\n"

Drones have been used to facilitate fast and accurate data collection, safe monitoring, and needs assessment among displaced populations. Data collected with UAV technology is then used to plan UN assistance and aid delivery to the affected populations. Agricultural uses for drones include crop production, early-warning systems, disaster risk reduction, forestry, fisheries, and wildlife conservation. Data collection in agriculture can be more efficient with drones, and this report highlights the many cases where it has already had an impact.\n\n"

The threshold levels of interference detrimental to radio astronomy observations were developed for Earth-based observations. In portions of the spectrum that can be observed only by space-based radio telescopes, no protection criteria have been developed specifically for space-based radio astronomy observations.\n\n"
