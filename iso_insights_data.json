In essence, it allows computers to understand humans – and speak like them. If developed correctly, it could bridge the gap between people and machines, thereby opening a whole new realm of possibilities.\nNLP is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that applies machine learning and other technologies to text or speech. The research was founded on Alan Turing’s ideas and John Searle’s experiments in the 1950s. Most people will only have come into contact with it when personal computing became more widespread and Microsoft’s “Clippy” asked you if you wanted to write a letter or the red squiggly line suggested you may have spelled a word wrong.\nFast-forward a couple of decades and NLP is now a rapidly growing field that combines computer science, artificial intelligence (AI) and linguistics to analyse and understand human language (NLP AI).\nHere, we open up the dense world of natural language processing in AI in order to break down the basics, look at some of the tools and techniques behind it and explore some of the myriad uses for it today, giving you a solid foundation to build your understanding and help you answer the question: what is NLP?",

News today is rife with startling reminders of how climate change is affecting people around the world, from wildfires and floods to the loss of biodiversity and even human lives. But what exactly is climate change?\nClimate change refers to the long-term transformation of Earth’s weather conditions. The phenomenon is caused by a number of natural and human-induced factors. Imagine the Earth as a giant greenhouse. Normally, the sun’s heat comes in and keeps things warm enough for us to live comfortably. But when we burn fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas for energy, we release extra gases into the air. These gases trap more heat, making our “greenhouse” warmer than it should be. This leads to glaciers melting, sea levels rising, and weather events like hurricanes and droughts becoming more extreme and frequent.\nThe growth and prosperity of businesses and organizations around the world should not come at the cost of the environment. While the challenge might seem overwhelming, there is a path to a sustainable future. Here, we explain some key terms related to climate change, such as greenhouse gases and net zero, and also uncover some of the tools organizations can adopt to address climate change and promote development in an integrated and balanced way.",

When the sun’s energy reaches the Earth, some of it is reflected back to space, while the rest is absorbed and re-radiated by greenhouse gases. These gases include water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and other gases naturally present in the atmosphere.",
                        "Think of it as a blanket. Just as a blanket keeps you warm by trapping body heat, greenhouse gases keep the Earth warm by trapping heat from the sun. This heat helps to maintain the Earth’s average temperature, making it hospitable for life as we know it.",
                        "In recent years, however, human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have increased concentrations of these greenhouse gases. The result? An increase in global temperatures that is fundamentally altering the planet’s climate system.",

While some changes can be attributed to natural phenomena (volcanic eruptions, solar radiation, tectonic shifts…), human activity is mostly to blame for the increased frequency and severity of natural disasters. But severe weather conditions are not just becoming more frequent, they are also getting much harder to predict.\nA changing climate can, directly or indirectly, affect many aspects of society in potentially disruptive ways. Floods and droughts damage our agriculture, rising sea levels erode our coastlines, and intense storms destroy our homes and communities. In short, climate change is disrupting all areas of life, including essential services such as transportation, telecommunications, energy and water supplies. Over time, scientists expect an increase in disease outbreaks, loss of life and population displacement, especially among the world’s most vulnerable communities.\nReversing the process calls for swift, decisive action. Nature-based solutions are an important piece of the puzzle, both for carbon storage and building climate resilience. Using natural resources to address environmental and climate challenges has enormous potential to reduce the negative impacts, while preserving the planet and its people.

It’s the most commonly produced greenhouse gas and traps heat in the atmosphere. This is known as the greenhouse effect. It warms the planet to temperatures that keep life on Earth livable. Without it, the world would be more like Mars: a frozen, uninhabitable place.\nThe delicate balance of life on our planet hinges on a complex array of factors. From erupting volcanoes and wildfires, to deforestation and fossil fuels, the carbon cycle is affected by nature and human activities. For example, the voracious burning of fossil fuels for energy is artificially amping up the carbon dioxide greenhouse effect. This results in rising temperatures that are altering the planet’s climate system, causing catastrophic climate change.\nHere, we take a look at what the greenhouse effect is, what causes it, and how we can temper its contributions to our changing climate.",

While in essence quite different, both these scenarios are requests to access personal data.\nBut what if the person requesting access to personal data is not who he or she claims to be? In general, there are two things you need to consider when asked to give out somebody’s personal information: the identity of the person asking for the data, and whether they have the right to access that data. The technical term for this is “access control”. Various access control examples can be found in security systems in password-coded doors, fob-controlled gates, badges, biometric systems, motion detectors, and so forth.\nA key component of information security, access control allows for streamlined control of movement around facilities or networks. In other words, it restricts the areas people can and cannot enter – be it a room or a computer. Back in the day, the simplest form of access control system would have been a standard lock and key. Today, it’s more likely to be an “access card” granting you entry to a secured area. Here, we take a closer look at how best to manage, monitor and track who has access to your door.",

It’s a moment in time where the potential for real, lasting impact is within reach. Throughout my career, I’ve been fortunate to collaborate with an incredible array of visionary individuals who have continually inspired me.\nIn the early years of my journey, as climate change became an urgent global issue, it was clear to me that energy management wasn’t just a technical necessity, it was a strategic lever for addressing greenhouse gas emissions and driving the energy transition. Today, this challenge is at the heart of boardrooms, investor strategies and corporate communications. For any meaningful shift to take place, every stakeholder must be on board, working together toward a shared goal.\nWe’ve seen profound shifts in response to climate change, especially within the energy sector. But the truth is, we’re only scratching the surface. To fully realize a sustainable, low-emissions future, we need to continue paving the way for a smoother transition, ensuring that businesses, communities and countries alike can all join in this critical transformation.",

Artificial intelligence (AI) has propelled us into a new era of technology and given rise to questions about what’s next. Across countries, we see deepening social and political divisions developing in parallel with rising temperatures in a rapidly warming world.\n\n\nSimultaneously, we have never been so connected to other countries and to each other. We are all in this together. There is a shared sense of urgency to act on global challenges, and we have more powerful technology than ever to deploy against today’s social and economic issues.\nHarnessing these opportunities to meet the challenges before us hinges on two things: our commitment to purpose and our ability to act on that purpose. Good governance empowers us to conquer on both fronts.\nWeak governance can undermine trust in organizations, damage reputations, incur heavy financial losses and lead to painful legal repercussions. But most importantly, poor governance prevents us from achieving the positive outcomes we so need: the wellbeing of people and planet. Good governance gives shape to an organization’s purpose and defines the contours of the value that organizations can generate. It enables that same organization to actively oversee – and course correct, if needed – its progress towards that purpose.\nFinally, with good governance comes accountability. This not only lays out good delegation systems where responsibilities can be distributed effectively and strategically. Accountability holds organizations responsible to those experiencing the consequences of their actions – positive or negative – and to stakeholders who want organizations to be aligned with their expectations throughout the journey.",

For too long, organizational leadership has been judged primarily by financial results. Therefore, it follows that an organization’s purpose has tended to align with financial objectives. It is time for organizations to go beyond finances and start actively contributing to environmental and social welfare. Whether it‘s combatting climate change, supporting local communities or addressing social inequalities, an organization’s work needs to ultimately transcend revenue generation; it needs to also be a force for positive change.",

Every decision made will naturally incur a mix of positive and negative outcomes on the factors that constitute value – financial, human, social, natural capital, etc. There will inherently be judgement calls to make and trade-offs to consider.

From decarbonization to the reduction of plastic pollution and the protection of natural resources, the urgency of the task rings loud and clear. The time to act is now.\nIn spite of this, global climate action suffers from an imbalance between adaptation and mitigation. Climate mitigation seeks to reduce the harmful impact of climate change by cutting emissions and transitioning to a more sustainable world. Climate adaptation, on the other hand, means empowering people and communities to build resilience to the impacts of climate change today. In essence, it refers to measures like building flood walls, diversifying crops and implementing early warning systems against acute climate shocks.\nCurrently, climate mitigation is receiving the majority of funding and is the central focus of policy discussions. However, as the impacts of climate change intensify, we must also enhance adaptation measures and increase the resilience of producers, communities, and landscapes. Through robust frameworks and a fair and just climate finance strategy, we can cope with climate change more effectively and put the world on a more sustainable trajectory.",

Without bold climate action, crops like coffee and bananas could become rare delicacies in the future. The livelihoods and wellbeing of farming communities are also very much in jeopardy. To build resilience, it is crucial to focus on the most vulnerable populations. Small-holder farmers, especially women, ethnic minorities, and those with limited access to resources, face disproportionate impacts from climate change and often have limited means to cope with its effects.",
                        "The Rainforest Alliance was founded over 37 years ago with the goal of combating deforestation, strengthening biodiversity, and promoting good agricultural practices. Among our global objectives, we listen to farmers and forest communities’ needs and support them with resilient natural solutions to adapt to climate change. This involves identifying and understanding climate risks and vulnerability levels, and developing and implementing adaptation strategies tailored to the specific needs of the most vulnerable groups, ensuring they are not left behind.",
                        "Empowering farmers with knowledge, tools, and resources to adapt to changing environmental conditions can help them become more resilient. To this end, we implement strategies for regenerative and climate-smart agriculture, agroforestry, community-based forest management and forest restoration, where farmers can learn sustainable techniques that enhance productivity and reduce environmental impacts, such as transitioning to organic fertilisers, from toxic to approved pesticides and chemical inputs, adopting regenerative and soil conservation practices, and using renewable energy sources, among others.",
                        "On the other hand, we understand that the journey toward sustainability is complex and demanding, which is why we advocate for shared responsibility in agriculture supply chains. We encourage consumers to recognize the producers’ commitment to sustainability when purchasing certified Rainforest Alliance products. Embracing shared responsibility is essential for fostering a sense of collective engagement where we are all in and for realizing that sustainable practices and collaborative efforts are the only way to safeguard our environment."

Yet as we look deeper into the complex processes that build our medical systems, we uncover a multitude of ways that AI could revolutionize patient care for better diagnoses.\nThis technology is already impacting healthcare in powerful ways. AI is supporting the detection of conditions like heart disease, rare diseases and cancer. But it is also streamlining administrative tasks like writing summaries and notes, freeing doctors from the burden of paperwork. This empowers them to spend more time and energy on what matters most: their patients.\nAs we continue to adopt and develop AI in healthcare, it is crucial we keep patients at the core of everything we do. When we co-founded Arkangel AI, an AI-powered platform focused on enhancing healthcare services, we were driven to empower providers to keep the human element at the forefront of their industry. With the unprecedented power of AI at our fingertips, we have a responsibility to create scalable solutions that meaningfully address global health challenges. We can’t fall into the trap of creating technology for technology’s sake. For instance, a cancer prediction algorithm is only truly impactful if it’s accessible to people and patients worldwide.

                        "In our experience, there are three major barriers that prevent AI from reaching its full potential in the healthcare sector.",
                        "The first is that most healthcare practitioners are not well versed in the ins and outs of technology and data management. There is a significant need for education around what technology is used for. Their expertise and focus is rightfully centred on the patients in front of them. AI experts need to work with decision-makers and practitioners themselves to help them understand how and where AI can help them, and build supportive infrastructure allowing them to use tools effectively, without impacting the time and energy they have for patients.",
                        "The second point is the lack of understanding of the actual problems that need to be solved. Without this, providers cannot determine where and how AI technology can deliver meaningful value. After that, it’s about seeing if there is data to solve that problem. Yes, there is a lot of data today, but it’s not always usable. However, there are always ways to find solutions as long as goals are clear and actionable.",
                        "The third and perhaps thorniest barrier is a lack of insight into the inaccessibility of healthcare in many parts of the world. Today, over half of the world’s population does not have access to healthcare services. AI can help enhance and expand essential healthcare coverage in low-access areas. In rural Latin America, for example, Arkangel AI is helping to create models that adapt to the basic infrastructure and capabilities available to healthcare professionals. This is helping reach people who don’t have access to specialist providers like radiologists, but it is also enabling early detection of diseases like malaria or the prediction of dengue to take preventive actions and reduce excessive contagion.",
                        "For patients to experience truly positive outcomes, healthcare institutions and governments must fix the underlying issues in their systems. This means taking a clear-eyed look focusing on the needs and demands of people. Designing AI tools that can only be implemented by a few – for a few – only risks widening the gap in healthcare inequality."

This was a strategic decision that aligns with SHRM’s commitment to accelerating holistic change through inclusion.\nLike many HR professionals, I was taken aback by this decision. Equity is a fundamental pillar of creating fair and inclusive workplaces. It is about levelling the playing field of difference, not creating sameness. There is no diversity without difference. It is diversity in its fullest sense that drives creative conflict, that challenges assumptions, and feeds innovation.

While this might work for a limited time, it has diminishing returns.",

They overlook Gabriela’s experience setting up her own catering service and expertise in building a business from scratch. They ignore Gabriela’s ability to forge relationships and galvanize a team with her empathy and mentoring skills."

Hearts need to change as well.",

This requires new systems and processes, incentives and rules, examples and narratives. It must rely on a critical mass of employers shifting approaches and sharing their learnings so templates can emerge that lower the threshold for replication.",

By designing and codifying successful models and creating the right mix of accountability and incentives, standardization can push these models into the mainstream. At that point, they cease being an experiment and become table stakes. ISO’s technical committee on human resource management designs International Standards that do exactly this. ISO&nbsp30415, for example, provides comprehensive guidelines for developing, implementing and managing diversity and inclusion in organizations.",

If HR teams, hiring managers and employees can collectively shape the future of inclusive workplaces, we can envision a future where skills are weighted alongside certifications, where lived experience is valued as a complement to traditional education and where trainability and learnability are the primary stock in trade.

It is also this ingenuity that drives us to perpetually innovate and create, shaping the future we will all inhabit. But for us to make progress on challenges – from renewable power to healthcare – we need a consistent system for measurements.\nMetrology is an invisible foundation for quality of life. The science of measurements establishes and maintains a common framework of definitions which we can all use. It links all human activity and is powered by a continuous cycle of accuracy that drives science and technology forward. Most recently, in 2019, member states of the Metre Convention revised the International System of Units (SI) to redefine four of the seven base units – the kilogramme, ampere, kelvin and mole – in terms of constants that describe the natural world. The kilogramme, for example, has since been defined in terms of the Planck constant.\nWe are the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany’s national metrology institute. From clean water to photovoltaics, we are always looking for accuracy and precision in measurement. Under the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, we deliver services to the public sector and industry on all questions regarding reliable measurements. Besides, we are proud to have played a key role in development cooperation for the past 60 years. Alongside our partner countries, we advise governments, promote institutions and support small and medium-sized enterprises. The projects we implement are funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nWhile much of our scientific work is based on the SI units and their dissemination, our work in the realm of development cooperation encompasses other dimensions. There, our efforts pertain mainly to the measuring and development of an arguably more abstract characteristic: quality.",

Most importantly, in our view, metrology is built on the heartfelt conviction that quality is a public good. But proving compliance of products and services with national and international specifications requires a consistent network, known as quality infrastructure.",
                        "This internationally recognized quality infrastructure helps protect consumers and the environment, grow the global economy, combat poverty and unemployment and improve social performance. Because, in practice, quality underpins everything from the filling quantities of prepackaged goods like tuna or toothpaste to the protection of healthy competition in the open market.",
                        "The quality infrastructure is built on five key pillars: standardization, metrology, conformity assessment, accreditation and market surveillance. By complying and subscribing to such a universal quality framework, organizations – regardless of their size, industry sector and location – are held accountable. This fosters a culture of transparency, clarity and trust in international trade and cross-sector partnerships. The same applies to countries: once they have developed a functional quality infrastructure, they can better integrate into global value chains, thereby boosting their economies.",
                        "Defining quality, however, is an impossible task without clarity on how to measure it. It’s vital that we make sure the measurements we all use are accurate and as future-proof as possible, so they are ready to accommodate future advances in science and technology."

For metrology to have a truly meaningful and long-lasting impact, it must be woven into the day-to-day lives of people. For instance, as developed countries around the world look to shift their transportation systems towards electric vehicles, it is essential that charging stations are checked correctly and regularly so that consumers can rely on the accuracy of their top-ups. Just like drivers had to agree on what a litre or a gallon of fuel represented, EV owners will need to know exactly how much power they’re charging into their batteries.",
                        "In the developing world, our efforts to integrate emerging economies into the global quality infrastructure must answer several key questions. What are the quality-related strengths and weaknesses of the partner countries? What are the demands of users of quality services, such as industry and consumers? What resources and systems can we leverage? How can we make results sustainable in the long term?",
                        "To be truly effective in “real life”, our cooperation initiatives must marry global consensus and tailor-made solutions specific to unique contexts. There is no room for a one-size-fits-all approach in our search for accuracy. For instance, merchants in some local markets in Sub-Saharan Africa still measure volumes of rice with tin cans – which is what best fits their context. In that case, our mission isn’t to replace a functioning system. Rather, we try to find those actors, cases and products that have the potential to foster economic growth or a safer environment by improving their quality. This empowers them to participate in the global trade network. Not by lowering barriers to access, but by providing the tools necessary to “plug in” to the internationally recognized quality infrastructure."

The recent Standards Engage! project, for example, had two main objectives: to increase effective stakeholder engagement in the standardization work of national standards bodies; and to enhance the recognition of the value and benefit of standards by public- and private-sector stakeholders in developing countries.",
                        "It is a luxury to have no grey areas. At PTB, our mission is to make that luxury a common good. But for this to happen, we must stay true to what is true. Together, metrology and standardization contribute to an internationally recognized quality infrastructure that fosters sustainable economic, social and ecological development.
