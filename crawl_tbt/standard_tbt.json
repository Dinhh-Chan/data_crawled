        "description": "<p>The circular (N&deg; 31/MF/DGD/SP/D01/10 of 5 January 2010) by Algerian customs effectively delays and/or blocks a total amount exceeding 206 million euro due to shipowners.<br />In short the problems relates to:<br />- A shipping line is a commercial entity expecting due payment for the services rendered, as well as compensation for use of its equipment (containers).<br />- While much of the cargo shipments will be paid at the port of loading, some Algerian importers demand freight payable upon receipt at destination, for commercial or regulatory reasons. Normally one should expect importers, having ordered goods from abroad under letters of credit, to take delivery of the goods soon after arrival, i.e. in a matter of few days or weeks.<br />- In practice, however, we observe that many importers delay taking receipt of their cargoes, quite some even many months after arrival. This means that the shipping line has to wait for payment and containers remain blocked for other use in shipping.<br />- It sets restrictions in the repatriation of freights by the shipping lines. Any income from freight due to the shipping lines and received by the line&rsquo;s agent from importers later than 90 days after arrival of the vessel may not be transferred outside Algeria.<br />- Algeria does not allow operators which share vessels in order to ensure more frequent calls and higher quality to open disbursement accounts (system of slot chartering).<br />- very cumbersome and time consuming control system of customs for the final disbursement account are in place, thus costly for all concerned and delaying legitimate transfers.</p>\n<p>At the end of 2015, as a result of pressure from the EU, rules were changed for the future (notably by allowing operators to open supplementary disbrusement accounts for payments received beyond the 90 day-deadline). The Algerian authorities, however, modified the logistical rules charging the costs related to the management of empty containers on shipowners: in the past, as can be seen from the bill of lading conditions, the cost of empty container operations, including reloading, was paid by Algerian receivers.</p>",

In contrast to Algerian companies, they, not being Algerian residents, are not in the possibility to recover the VAT.

The imposition of VAT on services rendered to vessels and cargo goes against international practice in the shipping sector. Moreover, Algerian shipping companies are &ndash; as any shipping company - subject to a zero VAT rate in the Member States of the European Union, according to European law and national legislation implementing the European legal rules (Directive 2006/112/EC). By consequence and following the adoption of the above mentioned Communication, the principle of reciprocity is not respected anymore today.</p>",

The new rules require that the company should register in only one of the sub-categories of the new nomenclature.<br />The deadline was fixed to 31/12/2021. However, by a note from the Ministry of Finance to the Association of Algerian banks in August 2021, operators were invited to accelerate the re-registration process and make all necessary changes by 31/10/2021, or otherwise they would not be allowed to obtain bank authorisations to pay for the imported goods. In addition, by a note from the Ministry of Trade of 01/09/2021, companies importing cosmetics and like goods are obliged to immediately renew their import authorisations and re-register their activities as above, or otherwise they will not be authorised to import such goods.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Second measure</span>: the rules in the 2021 Budget Law imposed a 49%-cap on foreign ownership on newly established corporations engaged in the importation of goods. All importing companies need to renew their registrations but the foreign-owned importing companies would be subject to greater burden and obligations than the local national ones, as the former would become subject to the 49-51% ownership rule.

The circular is causing them serious operational, legal and financial issues.</p>\n<p><u>Operational issues:</u></p>\n<p>The criterion being used to allocate goods in dry ports (the availability of storage space) appears inadequate. In the absence of an efficient common system linking Algerian customs to Off-Dock Container Yards (ODCYs), it seems technically challenging to obtain reliable real-time information. Besides, the truck capacity deployed to handle the cargo from the port centre to the imposed ODCY is unknown.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the imposed ODCY may not be equipped to receive certain cargo (hazardous, reefer, LCL containers). Under these conditions, shipping companies may be forced to delay the delivery of such goods.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the tracking of cargo between the port of unloading and the imposed ODCY will be made difficult. To-date, it remains unclear how recipients will be informed of the final location of their cargo. This last minute-allocation induces delays, additional and unnecessary costs.</p>\n<p>These measures are hampering operations and worsening the congestion in the port of Algiers where the circular applies, besides being detrimental to the Algerian customers and European exporters. Some of them have already refused to load until the situation is back to normal.</p>\n<p><u>Legal issues:</u></p>\n<p>The absence of a legal and contractual framework between the shipping companies and ODCYs is problematic. For instance, the circular does not specify who is legally responsible for transporting cargo from the port of unloading to the dry port, nor does it address the issue of liability in case of an accident during the journey.</p>\n<p>In addition, the existing agreements between receiver customers and the dry port managers (regarding for example &ldquo;free time&rdquo; that has to do with storage in dry port) will no longer apply. This will cause legal uncertainty and confusion.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the circular is posing concerns in terms of competition law, by unduly favouring national dry ports, to the detriment of privately foreign-owned facilities. European shipping companies feel that this discriminatory treatment is unjustified.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The main requirement is to obtain and present a certificate to be issued by ALGEX (the Algerian Agency for Export Promotion) attesting that the product intended to be imported is not produced locally. This constitutes a sine qua non condition for any Algerian bank (that are solely authorised to finance imports) to accept the application for and conduct such payment transactions.

The decree stipulates that the granting of an import license is in particular conditioned on previous efforts to procure the concerned products locally or on other efforts to support domestic production.&nbsp;In addition, the Decree foresees quantitative restrictions for certain products.</p>\n<p>You can find the original decree <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjUnvGbjZ7uAhWFBGMBHQetCt0QFjAAegQIAxAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fuiza.co.ao%2Findex.php%2Fdocumentos%2Fcategory%2F4-diarios-da-republica.html%3Fdownload%3D160%3Aregulamento-da-cadeia-comercial-de-oferta-de-bens-da-cesta-ba%25CC%2581sica-e-outros&amp;usg=AOvVaw1KWNkcAaKJXFtbl7iKlUZJ\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Presidential Decree 23/19 was revoked by Presidential Decree 213/23 in order to address concerns expressed by Angola&rsquo;s trading partners. However, the new Decree proposes measures which introduce non-automatic licences based on domestic purchase requirements.&nbsp;<strong>Decree 213/23 is still under consultations - not&nbsp;entered into force yet.</strong></p>\n<p>Article 4 of the new Presidential Decree 213/23 contains a quantitative restriction in the sense of Article XI:1 GATT which apparently does not qualify for any exceptions and is therefore arguably at odds with the GATT/WTO rules.</p>\n<p>On the assumption that the non-automatic licensing regime instituted by Article 7 is conditional upon the fulfilment of the requirement set out in Article 4 (i.e. no availability of like domestic products), this licensing regime is arguably as well in breach of Article XI:1 GATT, in addition to an apparent infringement of Article 1.2 of the WTO Import Licensing Agreement.</p>",

However, export duties remained in place for soy, biodiesel, raw hides and skins, cork, paper for recycling, ferrous waste and scrap, some mineral fuels and oils and works of art.</p>\n<p>In September 2018, in the midst of a financial crisis and due to increased fiscal needs, a horizontal export duty of 12% was reinstated until end 2020 (Decree 793/2018). This rate was applied in addition to the already applicable export duties, but was subject to&nbsp;different kind of caps to the overall export duty to be paid (expressed in AR$ per exported US dollar).</p>\n<p>With Degree 39/2019 of 14 December 2019, the new government introduced important amendments to Decree 793/2018. It maintained the previously established additional horizontal export duty of 12%, but eliminated in general the cap to the overall export duty to be paid. This had the consequence that for certain products export duties reached 17 to 22% (certain hides and skins, cork), 27% (biodiesel), or even 30% (soy). Certain caps&nbsp;however&nbsp;remained, and&nbsp;a reduced&nbsp;export tax of 9%&nbsp;applied for specifically listed products.</p>\n<p>The law on social solidarity of 23 December 2019 (Law No. 27,541) authorized the President of Argentina&nbsp;to increase further those export duties, for soy to up to 33%.</p>\n<p>With&nbsp;Decree 230/2020 of 4 March 2020, the President made use of this authority, hereby however applying as regards soy a staggered approach that imposes an export duty between 20% and 33%,&nbsp;depending on the&nbsp;exported amount per year. The full 33% export duty, for example, only applies to big producers exporting more than 1000 tons of soy per year. As regards other products, export duties were in some cases increased and in other 25 cases decreased, with the apparent intention&nbsp;to protect smaller producers and&nbsp;to consider regional needs at provincial level. Also export duties on services were reduced from 12% to 5%.</p>\n<p>Decree 549/2020 of 24 June 2020 suspended export duties on raw hides and skins for 60 days, in an attempt to rescue the sector in&nbsp;view of&nbsp;collapsing exports and prices in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.</p>\n<p>To alleviate the effects of the Coronavirus crisis for SMEs, Resolution 4728/2020 of 01 June 2020 allowed SMEs to extend due payments for export duties for 60 days until end of July. Resolution 4787/2020 of 05 August 2020 extended this period for further 60 days until end of September 2020. Beneficiaries of this exceptional measure were more than 25.000 Argentine SMEs.</p>\n<p>Decree 785/2020 of 2 October 2020 reduced by 4 percentage points (to 8%) the export duties applicable to certain minerals including cobblestone, marble, and granite, among others, until 31 December 2021.</p>\n<p>Decree 789/2020 of 5 October 2020 reduced the export duties applicable to certain final industrial goods and inputs. The decree (i) fixed a 0% export duty on final industrial goods included in Annex I; (ii) fixed an average export duty of 3% on industrial inputs included in Annex I; (iii) reduced to 0% the duties charged on exports of automobiles (including tractors, buses, trucks and cars) insofar as those operations are destined to non-Mercosur countries and they exceed the total exported between October 2019 and October 2020; and (iv) increased the rates of the export refunds applicable on inputs and final industrial goods to 5% or 7%, depending on the product.</p>\n<p>Decree 793/2020 of 5 October 2020 reduced the export duties applicable to biodiesel and different soy products, including soybeans, soy oil, pellets, and soy flour, among others, in a staged process, starting with a reduction by 5 percentage points, which is over the following months cut down. As of 1 of January 2021, the export duties applicable to these goods will be 2 percentage points lower than those in force prior to the issuance of Decree No. 790/2020, except for soybeans (which will be subject to the same export duty as before the issuance of the Decree) and biodiesel (with a reduction of only 1 percentage point).</p>\n<p>Decree 1060/2020 of 30 December 2020 modified the export duties for nearly 4400 products, representing 43% of the covered products, in an effort to stimulate industrial production and protect agricultural producers in the provinces. As regards industrial goods, it continues the policy launched by decree 789/2020 of 5 October 2020 and applies a scheme of 0 % export duties for another 362 finalized industrial goods, 3% export duties for another 1092 advanced industrial inputs, and 4.5% export duties for around 4000 primary or basic industrial inputs. Additionally, it eliminates export duties for a wide range of agricultural goods from the provinces. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Decree 150/2021 of 8 March 2021 modified Decree 789/2020 of 5 October 2020 insofar that it maintained the level of export duties for cars at 4.5% but introduced for 2021 an export duty exemption for incremental exports, meaning car exports that surpass the export levels of 2020.

        "description": "<p>All government levels in Argentina&nbsp;(nation, provinces and municipalities) have the power to establish preferences to the public procurement of goods and services of national, provincial or municipal origin. In addition, public companies or decentralized entities may have their own public procurement regimes.</p>\n<p>At national level, Law 27,437 of 2018 established a new &ldquo;Buy Argentina&rdquo; (\"<em>Compre Argentino</em>\") regime. The Law adopted by the Congress in April 2018 and published in May 2018 contains various discriminatory provisions in favor of national companies, goods or services.</p>\n<p>Main provisions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The law establishes that public entities shall grant a preference for companies offering local goods in their purchases, when the difference with imported goods is equal to or less than of 15% for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and 8% for other companies. Such preference is mandatory above a relatively low threshold (in May 2018, equivalent to approximately &euro;63,000).</li>\n<li>The above-described preferences of 15% and 8% can be reduced to 5% for the acquisition of goods of high technological scientific content (except for SMEs during the three first years from the enforcement of the Law).</li>\n<li>The law foresees a mechanism to provide incentives, in case of competition among goods that do not have a national origin, to those goods that contain the highest percentage of local content: offers without national origin have a preference margin of 1% every 5 percentage points of national content in the gross production value of the goods, up to a maximum preference of 8%.</li>\n<li>In addition to the above, the Law also includes specific preferences for national MSMEs. MSMEs offering goods of national origin in binding processes will have the possibility of improving their offers when their price has not exceeded more than 20% the best price in the process. In case of contracts of up to ARS 1.3 million in goods or ARS 100 million in works in housing and public buildings, the national administration shall award their contracts to local MSMEs that offer goods or works of national origin.</li>\n<li>The Law applies at central level but also contains a mechanism aimed at encouraging Provinces to adhere to the Law: there is an additional preference of 1% for goods produced in Provinces adhering to the Law, within three years of its entry into force.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most Provinces and some Municipalities have also established preference regimes that favour local bidders. The thresholds depend on each jurisdiction, although have been normally set around 5% (however, they may start revising them in line with the new national &ldquo;Buy Argentina&rdquo; Law). Bidders are considered local if they offer goods produced in the concerned jurisdiction&rsquo;s territory or if they have legal domicile in that jurisdiction for a determined time. Local bids are favoured in the sense that they will succeed even though they are higher than competing non-local bids.</p>\n<p><strong><em>National content requirement for renewable energies:</em></strong> In December 2006 the government enacted Law 26190, modified by Law 27191 in September 2015, which established the so-called &ldquo;National Promotion Regime for the Use of Renewable Energy Sources&rdquo;. It is applied by the Secretariat of Energy. The Law establishes different benefits, including some fiscal incentives and financial support mechanisms. Among these tools, a preference in the selection of offers in public procurement and a discount in the maintenance cost of the World Bank guarantee.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Background</u></strong></p>\n<p>The barrier has been in place in different forms for a long time, except in the period between 1991 and 2001.</p>\n<p>A first \"Buy Argentine\" legislation was applicable until its suspension in 1991. In 2001, the Economic Emergency Law No. 23697 reintroduced a preference in favour of domestic industry for the procurement and contracting of goods, works and services by public entities, with a maximum of 10% domestic preference in the case of goods. This provision was subsequently repealed by Law No. 25551 &ldquo;Buy Argentine Labour&rdquo; (&ldquo;<em>Compre Trabajo Argentino</em>&rdquo;), which established preferences for goods of domestic origin of 7% (for SMEs) or 5% (for other enterprises).</p>\n<p>In addition, since 2012 all companies with exporting activities, irrespective of their SME status, were also given a preference margin of 7%. Different preferences for local suppliers were introduced in the tenders for renewable energy launched by the Ministry of Energy (current Secretariat of Energy) since 2016.</p>\n<p>The new, above described&nbsp;Law N&ordm; 27,437 on &ldquo;Buy Argentina and Development of Suppliers&rdquo; was published in May 2018 and entered into effect three months later. Its implementing Decree N&ordm; 800/2018 was adopted in September 2018.</p>",

Restrictive patentability criteria combined with difficulties to enforce patents granted, as well as the patent examination backlog make effective patent protection in Argentina very difficult, notably for pharmaceuticals, agro-chemicals and biotechnological innovations. As a result, Argentina is the only G20 member where the number of patent applications has decreased over the last years. Measures to address the patent examination backlog have not borne fruit and it still takes up to 10 years to examine a patent in the pharmaceutical, agro-chemical and biotechnology fields. This backlog is reportedly due in part to the fact that INPI does not have enough specialised staff in these areas and limited financial autonomy.</p>\n<p>Another area of continued concern reported by stakeholders is the system for protecting undisclosed test and other data generated to obtain marketing approvals for pharmaceutical and agrochemical products. Stakeholders report that the Confidentiality Law provides some rules on confidentiality concerning data submitted for the market authorisation of pharma products, while allowing Argentinian authorities to rely on that data to approve requests by competitors to market similar products.&nbsp; The uncertain protection of regulatory test data deters innovators from bringing modern medicines to the Argentinian market.</p>\n<p>As regards copyright and related rights, Argentina does not provide adequate legal protection against the circumvention of technological protection measures for performers and phonogram producers as required in Article 18 of the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT).</p>\n<p><em>IPR enforcement:</em></p>\n<p>IPR enforcement remains a source of serious concern. IPR infringements are still widespread in Argentina due to the lack of enforcement capacities, appropriate training, dissuasive sanctions and the low number of seizures by customs authorities, in particular when acting on their own initiative. In terms of judicial action, stakeholders report lengthy and unpredictable proceedings, in particular for foreign plaintiffs, as well as difficulties in obtaining damages. Stakeholders report that addressing IP infringements is not a priority for the government.</p>\n<p>As regards copyright piracy, stakeholders report lack of awareness in the Argentinian society. Enforcement against copyright infringements (audio-visual, e-books and music) is almost non-existent &ndash;unlicensed music and audio-visual services are widely available. There is no notice and take down procedure, and hence, all notifications need to go via the judicial system. This is ineffective, especially regarding urgent or provisional measures. Stakeholders report that third-party injunctions against intermediaries are not easily available. As to IP enforcement in general, there is a deficit of specialised judges or public prosecutor offices.. Without the necessary expertise, court decisions lack consistency and preliminary injunctions are almost impossible to obtain, in particular with regard to patents. Sanctions and sentences actually imposed appear not to be deterrent enough to prevent further infringement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

There are separate regulations for the registration of wines and spirits, on the one hand, and agricultural and foodstuffs, on the other. However, no EU GI or DO has been registered up to date. Without registration, EU GI holders lack legal means to defend their rights in the country. One of the major difficulties is that GI denominations considered as &ldquo;generic&rdquo; names cannot be registered, and many European GIs are considered in Argentina and mentioned as such in the local food codex &ldquo;Codigo Alimentario&rdquo;. There are concerns on misappropriation of many European GI names.</p>\n<p>GI protection for wines and spirits is in place since January 2004 (when Law No 25163 of 1999 entered into force) and for agricultural and food products since May 2009 (when law No 25380 of 2001 became effective).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the same time the existing Mercosur rules (MERCOSUR/GMC/Resoluci&oacute;n N&deg;26/03 - transposing TRIPS requirements) and implemented in Argentina by Resolution 146/2004 on labelling of packaged foods, establishes that the geographical appellations of a country, a region or a population, recognised as places, in which are manufactured foods with specific characteristics, cannot be used for labelling or advertisement of foods manufactured in other places when this can mislead the customer. It prohibits the use of the expression \"type\" to names associated with wines and spirits (TRIPS requirement) but allows it for agricultural products and foodstuffs. This latter increases the risk that those names become \"generic\".</p>\n<p>In addition, there is widespread misappropriation of European GI names notably in the wine and spirit sector (for instance private operators try to obtain registration of European GI names, logos or official mentions as trademarks).</p>\n<p>Association Agreement EU-Mercosur:</p>\n<p>After implementation of this Agreement, many European geographical indications will receive protection&nbsp;both at administrative and judicial level, and directly based upon that Agreement. The Agreement includes protection against the use of \"type\" \"style\" (etc) and misleading flags and symbols.</p>\n<p>The list of protected geographical indications of the EU comprises 357 names. As regards some names, transition periods (\"phasing-out\", which allow re-naming and positioning in the markets) are foreseen, and in some very few exceptions so-called &ldquo;grand-fathering\" (with specific labelling conditions). Argentina published lists with the concerned geographical indications in springtime 2020 with a view of establishing the relevant lists of previously used national names.</p>\n<p>The Parties will review this list regularly, with the possibility of agreeing on the addition or elimination of names. If no consensus is reached, owners might make use of the national system to protect their geographical indications in Argentina.</p>",

        "description": "<p>On 5 April 2019, Australia submitted its instrument of accession to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA). The GPA entered into force for Australia on 5 May 2019, providing an opportunity to address outstanding access issues, particularly at the sub-central level involving the Australian States and Territories.</p>\n<p>At the central (Commonwealth) level, the Australian Government Procurement market is largely non-discriminatory and transparent, governed by the Commonwealth Procurement Rules (CPRs). This framework is built around the core principle of achieving value for money through competition (i.e. non-discrimination); efficient, effective and ethical procurement; accountability and transparency; consideration of risk; and conducting a process commensurate with the scale and scope of the procurement.</p>\n<p>Additional requirements exist for procurement above certain thresholds, but a number of \"sensitive\" sectors &ndash; including property and accommodation, motor vehicles, research and development services, defence-related procurement, blood plasma products, business servicing the disabled, and indigenously-owned SMEs - are exempted from these additional requirements (these sectors are also generally exempt from coverage of the procurement chapters in Australia&rsquo;s FTAs).</p>\n<p>In the significant amendment to procurement rules by the Australian Finance Minister in 2022, the CPRs now require a minimum of 20% of all procurement by value to be sourced from SMEs. This marks a doubling of the previous target of 10% to ensure broader support for SMEs. Additionally, the changes guarantee that at least 35% of contracts valued up to $A20 million originate from SMEs, defined as Australian or New Zealand firms with fewer than 200 full-time equivalent employees. Australian officials argue this does not imply any discrimination in favour of SMEs, as the CPRs elsewhere make clear that SMEs will win government business only if they are competitive. In practice, SMEs' share of Commonwealth procurement far exceeds the 20% target: 27% of total value for 2020-2021, 30.8% for 2021-2022, and 27.3% for 2022-2023.</p>\n<p>At the sub-central level, State and Territory governments each have their own policies and legislation governing procurement. Sub-central governments, such as Victoria, may require suppliers to meet a minimum local content in public procurement for \"strategic\" projects, or may impose weighting for local content criterion in tender evaluation, as is the case in Victoria and South Australia. Western Australia retains a price preference scheme in which it imposes surcharges on goods with a certain proportion of imported content, which works to the advantage of Australian and NZ suppliers. Through the Western Australian Buy Local Policy, a 20% price increase is applied to the portion of a bid that comprises a good, service or items that have been sourced from overseas, excluding New Zealand. However, countries possessing free trade agreements under which state governments are bound by procurement provisions (currently New Zealand, the United States, Chile, Korea and Japan) are excluded from these schemes and requirements.</p>",

It is seen as a remnant of the old luxury goods taxes from the 1980s, but it was introduced at the same time as the GST in Australia in 2000. It was widely considered to be designed to protect Australia's domestic automobile manufacturing industry, however, domestic automobile manufacturing ceased in 2017, removing the main rationale for the tax.</p>\n<p>In December 2023, the Australian Government announced that the requirements to access the &nbsp;fuel efficient threshold from less than 7L per 100km to under 3.5L per 100 km.

        "country": "Brazil",
        "description": "<p>Complex domestic taxation systems which include multiple cascading and discriminatory taxes pose challenges to EU companies operating in Brazil. Litigation is endemic to determine whether one tax should be included in the base for calculating another tax.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong>&nbsp;Proposals for tax reform have been under consideration for many years but have faced resistance from vested interests. There is a widely recognised need to&nbsp;simplify the indirect tax system. Modifications so far were limited to replacing corporate social security charge by a lower charge applied to corporate revenues and the introduction of differential tax rates for domestic and nationally produced goods (PIS/COFINS) with the aim of compensating for the difference in taxable base between the two taxes due to a Supreme Court decision. This added to the complexity and ambiguity of the system in particular in relation with imported products. Additional main concerns for EU operators pertain, in particular, the CIDE tax, levied on the transfer of any kind of \"technology\", the high tax rates applied to imported perfumes, the increase of PIS/COFINS levied on imports. The Reintegra programme for tax reimbursements of exports remains on the books but the credit has been reduced to 0.1%.</p>\n<p>In December 2023, in a historic achievement, Congress <strong>adopted tax reform</strong> to replace five separate consumption&nbsp;taxes with a value-added tax (a federal VAT and a state/municipal VAT).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The reform, to be phased in over eight years starting in 2026, will replace&nbsp;PIS, Cofins, IPI, ICMS e ISS with a dual VAT system. Such simplification is welcome for all taxpayers &ndash; including companies from the EU &ndash; even if critics point to the high number of exceptions to the new rules, following lobbying by domestic interest groups.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The standard VAT rate is yet to be determined. Due to the number of exemptions, it may end up as high as 27.5% but still an improvement over the current opaque, overlapping and regressive taxes. The reform will gradually shift taxation from the point of production to the point of consumption.</p>\n<p>Previously, the lack of alignment with OECD standards on <strong>transfer pricing</strong> was a major problem for EU businesses. This was resolved in June 2023 when Brazil brought its law in line with OECD standards. The new rules entered into force from 1 January 2024.</p>\n<p><br />Other concerns of EU companies remain:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Problems related to taxation of \"technological knowledge\" transfer due to the discriminatory nature of the CIDE tax (tax on the contribution for intervention in the economic domain), which was established by Law 10168/2000 and further complemented by Law 10332/2001. CIDE is collected to provide financial support to priority scientific and technological development programs and projects. CIDE is levied on payments made by Brazilian companies to foreign suppliers which provide inter alia some kind of \"technological knowledge\" such as patent assignments, trademarks or technical assistance services. Since 2006, CIDE no longer applies to software, except when it involves transfer of the corresponding technology (Articles 20 and 21 of Law 11452/2007). CIDE amounts to 10% of the underlying transaction. However, the retroactive effect of the law with regard to software only goes back to 1 January 2006. By contrast, Brazilian companies are not subject to CIDE when they pay for the acquisition or use of domestically produced \"technology\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Taxation of perfumes versus \"eau de toilette\" &ndash; Due to the lack of fiscal or custom legislation that precisely defines perfume and \"eau de toilette\", Brazilian fiscal administration uses Decree 79094/77, which was complemented by a sanitary regulation, making&nbsp;the distinction between these two products on the basis of their respective concentration of aromas. As a result of this distinction, Brazilian importers (ADIPEC - Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o dos Distribuidores e Importadores de Perfumes e Cosm&eacute;ticos) confirmed that most Brazilian domestic products are classified as &rsquo;eau de toilette&rsquo; and taxed at an IPI (Tax on Industrial Products) rate of 12%, while most of imports from the EU are considered to be perfumes and taxed at 42%. The issue was also dealt with at EU-Brazil Joint Committee meetings. No progress was reported. However, according to the Ministry of Finance the differentiation was first introduced by decree 3.777 in 2001 and Brazil is in a right stemming from the Constitution to apply a higher tax to products considered a luxury good due to the higher concentration in essence/aromas of perfumes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction of an increased rate of PIS/COFINS for imports - PIS and COFINS increases for imported goods were officially introduced by the Provisional Measure (MP) 668/15 adopted and published on 30 January 2015. The combined PIS/COFINS rate for imports was increased generally by 2.5 percent (from 9.25 percent to 11.75 percent) with a higher increase for certain specific categories of products (pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, tyres etc.). The increased contributions applied as of 1 May 2015 (90 days after the publication as per the constitutional requirement). The MP 690/2015 was adopted by the Congress and published as Law 13.137/2015 of 19 June 2015.. Furthermore some imported products are subjected to a supplementary 1% PIS/COFINS tax, without the possibility of earning a tax credit. The tax hikes and credit restrictions affect only imported goods, which thereby are placed at a competitive disadvantage in the Brazilian market. According to the Brazilian Government, the rationale for the tax increase relates to a need to compensate for the difference between the taxable bases for imported products (that following the Supreme Federal Tribunal &ndash;STF &ndash; Ruling 55937/2013 and in accordance with the Constitution must be the customs value, without adding any other taxes or charges) and for domestic companies (where other domestically paid fiscal burdens are included i.e. ICMS). An STF ruling excluding ICMS from the calculation base of PIS/COFINS domestic was issued on 9 March 2017. This diminishes the differentiation of taxable base between PIS/COFINS domestic and import and thus increases the discrimination of the tax. The judgement was published and took effect on 2&nbsp;October 2017, but there is still a possibility to modulate the judgement, meaning that there will be a decision on its retroactive effect. In the start of 2018 Receita Federal (tax authorities) had still not taken measures to stop including the ICMS in the PIS/COFINS tax base <br /><br />PIS and COFINS are among the taxes due to be gradually <strong>replaced</strong> by the new VAT tax. As Congress works out the details of tax reform, discrimination against imports could potentially be abolished.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Reintegra</strong> - Law No. 12,546 of 14 December 2011 introduced the Special Regime for the Reimbursement of Taxes for Exporters, known as Reintegra. The programme enables exporters of manufactured goods to recover residual Indirect tax costs levied on the production chain, such as the Tax on Services (ISS), the financial transaction tax (IOF), and the royalty tax (CIDE). Under the current rules the exporter does not have to provide any calculation proving that the sums reimbursed corresponds to internal taxes imposed on the exported products. BR thus does not have a system in place that ensures that the reimbursed amount does not exceed the amount of indirect taxes paid.&nbsp;Companies that export goods manufactured in Brazil are entitled to a refund of their gross receipts from exports, to be used either as a credit against federal tax liabilities, or as a cash payment. Manufactured goods must: (i) be included in the Industrialized Products Tax Table ( Tabela de Incid&ecirc;ncia do Imposto sobre Produtos Industrializados &ndash; TIPI) and listed in an act issued by the Executive branch; and (ii) the cost of the imported content of the goods must not exceed a percentage of their export price. Decree No. 7.633 of 1 December 2011 provides a list of eligible goods and sets the maximum value of imported content at 40% for most products, except in the case of high-tech goods (e.g. pharmaceuticals, electronics, and aircraft and parts), which may have up to 65% of imported&nbsp; inputs. &nbsp;Imported goods do not benefit from the programme. Reintegra benefits were applied to exports made until 31 December 2012 with a reimbursement rate of 3%. It was then reinserted in 2014 with law 13.043/2014. The general Reintegra credit established by Decree 8.415 of 27 February 2015 was 3%. By means of Decree 9.148 of 28 August 2017, the Reintegra credit was reduced temporarily to 2% from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2018. Decree 9.393 of 30 May 2018 reduced further the Reintegra credit to 2% from 1 January 2017 to 31 May 2018 and to <strong>0.1%</strong> from 1 June 2018.&nbsp;<br /><br />At this minimal rate, Reintegra <strong>no longer poses a significant problem</strong> but requires continued monitoring, given proposals to increase it. Draft law 882/2023 in the Senate seeks to set the maximum reimbursement at 7.4% but the proposal has not progressed through the parliamentary system. <br /><br />In April 2024, Brazil's ministers of trade and finance announced potential plans for small and micro companies to enjoy a higher rate of tax reimbursement for industrial exports. This is envisioned as a transitional measure for 2025 and 2026. From 2027, the entry into force of tax reform will remove cumulative tax on exports, and there should no longer be a justification for Reintegra. <br />\n<p>In October 2024, Brazil's Supreme Court rejected a challenge by industrial associations of Reintegra's 0.1%<strong>&nbsp;</strong>rate. The Court ruled that the government was free to set the percentage. Media reported that the case involved an estimated R$ 49.9 billion (US$ 9.2 billion) in potential losses<br />for the government.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p>The main problems regarding intellectual property rights are a considerable registration backlog in patent and trademark applications, and a problematic limitation in Brazil's law on GIs. Another issue has been resolved: interference with pharmaceutical patent applications by the Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA).</p>\n<p>More recently, EU pharmaceutical companies have complained about the lack of protection for regulatory data submitted to the government. Patent law&nbsp;amendments under consideration at the Senate in <strong>2024</strong> are an opportunity to ensure such protection, and to introduce&nbsp;patent term adjustment to compensate for delays at INPI. However, such reforms face resistance from the domestic generics industry.</p>\n<p>A proposal to allow INPI to start analysing a patent immediately, without giving the applicant time (36 months in the current law) to update their application, seeks to accelerate procedures but it would in fact be counterproductive.</p>\n<p>The absence of compensation for delays generates uncertainty and discourages foreign investment. INPI argues that compensation is not needed because applications will be examined more efficiently in future. INPI aspires to reduce patent pendency to two years by 2026, but the credibility of this target is questionable, especially for pharmaceuticals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Background:</p>\n<p>INPI (the national IP office) recruited 210 extra staff in 2016-2017. This contributed to a reduction in the backlog for trademarks from 421.000 cases at the end of 2016 to 191.535 at the end of 2018. And an examination time down to 24 month for unopposed cases, to 12 month at the end of 2018. The new online application system for trademarks also contributed to speed up the registration process. INPI Resolution 248/2019 introduced the possibility of multi class applications. Brazil deposited the accession instrument to access the Madrid protocol on 3 July 2019, and the system entered into force for Brazil on 2 October 2019.<br /> <br /> For patents according to INPI information, the backlog was estimated at over 208.000 patents at the end of 2018, down from over 243.000 in 2016. The decrease in the backlog in 2017 was due to higher efficiencies and new processes, and a clean up process, where incomplete or expired applications were removed. Average patent examination times stood at 10 years with the pharmaceutical patents taking over 13 years on average.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In 2019, INPI introduced a new backlog reduction plan, that includes (for patent applications, submitted after 31/12/2016, or with no third party observation, or not already submitted to first technical examination by INPI, or not under any other fast track mechanism) the use of prior art search carried out in foreign IPO, and a simplification for applications where not such search has been carried out. In December 2021, INPI reported significant progress on its backlog reduction plan:&nbsp;nearly 38 000 applications were pending,&nbsp;most of which in chemistry, electrical and mechanical engineering. Progress in the pharmaceutical area is slow, causing serious concerns among companies in this sector. The overall backlog has shifted from the entry point to the analytical stage.</p>\n<p>In <strong>August&nbsp;2024</strong>, INPI monthly statistics on the backlog reduction plan indicated a backlog of&nbsp;1&nbsp;719 patent applications, with a decision reached on 84 088, and a further 64 083 applications permanently archived. Of those patent applications still pending, most (1 210) belong in the chemical field.</p>\n<p>In 2022, progress risked being jeopardised by a drastic cut in INPI's budget, but ultimately the government allocated additional funds to the Institute, averting a crisis. The budgetary situation at INPI needs to be monitored as future cuts cannot be excluded. While the long-term financial autonomy of INPI remains susceptible to pressure, the existential threat of 2022 has not been repeated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the past, health regulator ANVISA had to give prior approval (for public health reasons) for pharmaceutical patent applications. On 26 August 2021, Congress revoked with immediate effect Article 229-C of the <a href=\"https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.planalto.gov.br%2Fccivil_03%2Fleis%2Fl9279.htm&amp;data=04%7C01%7Celizabetta.albernaz%40fco.gov.uk%7Cdd0b1a7dd518473b43b208d9cee2814a%7Cd3a2d0d37cc84f52bbf985bd43d94279%7C0%7C0%7C637768294494801965%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=szpXDyDZxKuuWpFtChc22BHZZFOweNc61olS3XBmiBI%3D&amp;reserved=0\">Intellectual Property Law (9279/1996)</a> which required prior approval by the Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) for pharmaceutical patents. 1.284 patent applications which were awaiting prior approval by ANVISA were forwarded for consideration by the National Institute for Intellectual Property (INPI).</p>\n<p>A Senator proposed a draft law (2713/2021) that would reinstate ANVISA&rsquo;s role in approving patents. However, the proposal remains blocked in Congress.</p>\n<p>In February 2022, INPI reported it was requesting an additional 96 patent evaluators to join the 308 evaluators already working, in order to deal with the backlog of applications. This request was turned down.&nbsp;The Institute faces difficulties in attracting qualified personnel, competing with the private sector and other public institutions. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>INPI has an ambitious action plan 2023-2026 aiming to approve patent applications within two years of deposit, and use artificial intelligence to automate the flow. Stakeholders approve of the plan but question whether it is realistic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>INPI is making overall progress in reducing the backlog of patent applications but in the pharma sector progress is slower, due to the need for qualified examiners. In 2023, the government approved the hiring of 140 examiners, which is a positive development, even if less than the 400 examiners requested by INPI.</p>\n<p>In August 2024, INPI publishesed the names of 120 new employees, to be split equally across the patent, trademark, and administrative divisions.</p>\n<p>With regard to geographical indications, Brazilian law does not consider the registration of names that are not strictly geographical names.</p>\n<p>The EU's <em>IP Key</em> project opened an office at INPI's premises in Rio de Janeiro and has been collaborating closely,&nbsp;including a 2024 seminar in Belo Horizonte on geographic indications.

        "description": "<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">In late 2015, Brazil opened a consultation on draft standards of identity and quality of wine, grapes and grape derivatives (G/TBT/N/BRA/613),<br />which diverged from international OIV and EU standards on a number of parameters. Brazil received many comments to this draft standard from trading partners, including from the EU.<br />A reviewed version of the standard was then notified in mid 2016 by Brazilian authorities (G/TBT/N/BRA/675) to incorporate the relevant comments received. Since EU comments were only partially addressed, a set of comments was resubmitted to this new version.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The final rule, Normative Instruction 14, was published in the Brazilian Official Journal of 8 March 2018.&nbsp;It foresees a one-year adaption period.

EU wine industry is worried about future serious disruptions to trade due to the long list of analytical parameters and their divergences with OIV recommendations. The EU has invited Brazil, at the TBT Committee meeting of November 2018,&nbsp;to make use, to the maximum extent possible, of OIV recommendations and to consider accepting imported wines according to OIV oenological practices. The EU is prepared to work bilaterally with Brazil in this respect.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Brazil clarified that the amendment to Technical Regulation 14 is the continuation of a previously discussed measure, raised 8 times by the EU at the TBT Committee. Several bilateral meetings were held with the EU, who also participated in public consultations. Brazil considers that it has been very transparent during the whole adoption procedure and that pertinent EU comments were taken into consideration (6 out of 9 EU comments were taken on board). The Brazilian notification of the amendment as an Addendum follows the relevant TBT recommendations in this respect. Brazil maintains that it has acted in accordance with TBT provisions and that it has provided a 360-day period of transition, even allowing the sale of non-compliant products until the end of the expiration date. OIV standards have been taken into consideration, as long as permitted by legitimate objectives. Brazil recalled that the EU is the bigger seller of wine to Brazil and that it has acted in good faith by providing reasonable opportunities for comments. <br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">At the bilateral meeting with the EU in November 2018,&nbsp;Brazil noted that the recent amendment was just to correct some errors in the regulation and maintained that the EU had already provided extensive comments on regulation 14. Brazil clarified that they are also bound to respect MERCOSUR regional standards.<br /></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Products &ldquo;fora do padr&atilde;o&rdquo;: tipicity certifications.&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>Article 45 of MAPA's Normative Instruction 54/2009 provides that wines and grape-related and wine-related products that do not fall within the Brazilian identity and quality standards (for instance wines with alcoholic content above 14%, or below 8,5%, some sparkling wines) will only be cleared if there is an official certification of the following cumulative requirements: (i) that is a product that has typical characteristics, regional or from the country of origin; (ii) that is a product classified as a wine and, grape-related and wine-related product, under the law of the originating country; and, (iii) that is a product for normal and ordinary consumption and has the name and composition established in the region of the country of origin. According to this provision, the products that do not fall within the Brazilian standards but are protected by a geographical indication, will not require to certify these requirements, being therefore exempted from presenting a \"certificate of typicity\". In this case, a mention in the certificate of analysis and origin about the geographical indication is enough. The article had been implemented erratically by MAPA, however the situation improved for most products following the bilateral contacts of EUDEL with MAPA. The difficulties remain in particular for Spain with regard to sangria and natural cider. It could potentially affect other new products on the EU market without a precise categorisation under Brazilian legislation (blue wine, sparkling flavoured coolers, etc.), if exported to to this country in the future. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">&nbsp;</span></p>",

The captain, the chief engineer and two thirds of the crew of a Brazilian-flag vessel must be Brazilian nationals (article 4 - Law 9.432/1997).\n<p>For operating as a Brazilian navigation company, the domestic authority (ANTAQ) must grant an authorization. The authorization is granted only to a company established in Brazil under Brazilian law. The company must own at least one ship technically suitable for the intended navigation, or, bareboat charter a vessel owned by a Brazilian individual or legal person, suitable for the intended navigation and on condition of commercial operation, for a period equal to or greater than 1 (one) year. In order to operate as a Brazilian navigation company, only registration for legal persons is required, with representation and administration in Brazil. Brazil does not impose foreign equity restrictions. No restrictions apply to the origin of capital for the establishment of a multimodal transport operator in Brazil (article 2 - Law 9.432/1997; article 5 &ndash;Resolution ANTAQ No. 5 of 2016).</p>\n<p>Cabotage is reserved for Brazilian-flag vessels operated by Brazilian navigation companies authorized by ANTAQ. Foreign vessels may be authorized to operate cabotage when chartered by a Brazilian navigation company. This authorization may be granted when: a Brazilian-flag vessel of the required type is not available; for public interest reasons; or if the foreign vessel replaces a vessel that is under construction at a Brazilian shipyard. The Brazilian navigation companies can only bareboat charter ships that correspond to 50% of its own fleet. This means that only the companies that have vessels under their own property can bareboat charter (article 7 and 9 - Law No. 9,432 of 8 January 1997).</p>\n<p>In December 2021, Congress approved the BR do Mar program that aims to facilitate the expansion of cabotage operations and the entrance of new companies. The main proposal of change in the legislation is to increase the possibilities for Brazilian navigation comanies to charter vessels, without the obligation to have their own vessels. This is done mainly by allowing a company qualified in BR do Mar to charter vessels from its wholly owned foreign subsidiary for a period of time. The proposal was sanctioned on 2022,&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2019-2022/2022/Lei/L14301.htm\">Law 14.301/2022</a>.

The ruling confirms that such localisation policies, which favour domestic goods over imported goods, are illegal under WTO law.</p>\n<p>The EU had also challenged two additional programmes (PEC and RECAP) granting tax advantages for exporters in Brazil that met certain export threshold requirements. The Appellate Body did not confirm the ruling of the WTO Panel that the two export programmes are export-performance subsidies prohibited under WTO rules.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>A case&nbsp;was opened at the WTO in line with the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes.

It brought about the introduction of price preferences of up to 25% to bidders that produce in Brazil and that fulfil certain economic requirements. This came on top of already existing irritants such as the obligation for foreign companies to be legally established in Brazil to take part in national tendering. Furthermore, a range of local content requirements is enforced in concessions, public works and other contracts from the State or State-controlled enterprises.</p>\n<p>Being the Brazilian public sector the largest buyer of goods and services in the country, discriminatory government procurement policies are a substantial barrier to EU exports.</p>\n<p>Background</p>\n<p>The Federal Constitution establishes as a general rule that public procurement must be preceded by a public tender, subject to certain exceptions. The general rules for tendering procedures are defined in the following federal laws:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Law 8666/93 (amended by Law 12.349/2010) for administrative contracts for the supply of goods and services,</li>\n<li>Law 8987/95 for public services provided through concessions or permissions and</li>\n<li>Law 11079/04 for services provided through public-private partnerships.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sub-federal governments and state-owned enterprises can have specific rules for their tendering procedures, provided that they do not conflict with the federal legislation. In 19 July 2010, the Brazilian government amended Law No 8666/1993 with a provisional measure (later converted into Law 12349/2010, the so called \"Buy Brazil Act. This protectionist law introduced price preferences of up to 25% for Brazilian domestic products and services under specific conditions with the justification of achieving economic growth, national technological innovation and employment. The conditions relate to national manufactured products and services that meet the Brazilian technical standards, or alternatively, to specific R&amp;D activities performed in Brazil by the tenderers.</p>\n<p>The sectors and the margins of preference are determined by an inter-ministerial commission (Inter-ministerial Commission for Public Procurement, CICP) based on economic studies of the developmental impact of the sectors in question, namely taking into account criteria such as job creation and income generation, effect on tax revenues and development and technological innovation made in Brazil. However, the government can disregard these preferences if there is no local production or capacity to provide the services in Brazil.</p>\n<p>Law 12.349/10 does not exclude possible joint ventures or partnerships between foreign and Brazilian companies and extends the preferences to international companies from countries which have signed agreements on public procurement with Brazil, which includes so far Peru and other Mercosur countries.</p>\n<p>In addition to allowing for price preferences in certain sectors, the Buy Brazilian Act also allows to restrict procurement contracts in the ICT sectors considered as sensitive or strategic to goods and services developed and produced in Brazil.</p>\n<p>This came on top of already existing irritants for EU companies. For participating in national tendering, foreign companies have to set up a Brazilian company and to invest directly in the country to produce goods or services according to the Basic Productive Process (PPB - &ldquo;processo produtivo b&aacute;sico&rdquo;). PPB criteria are established by inter-ministerial decrees signed by the Ministers in charge of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade (MDIC) and of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI). Finally, foreign bidders, when participating in consortium with local Brazilian companies, the leader will be the Brazilian partner.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Brazil passed a new Public Procurement General Law in April 2021 (Law 14.133/2021), which will coexist for some time with Law 8.666/93.

These practices include:</p>\n<p><br /> &bull; Lower product mark-ups or taxes applied by some liquor boards on domestic wine and/or spirits than on imported wine and/or spirits (e.g. Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, British Colombia and Nova Scotia).<br /> &bull;&nbsp;Restrictions on private delivery and on access to points of sale that normally do not apply to domestic products. Sales of EU wines are only possible via the liquor boards while domestic products in some provinces can be sold either through private outlets, farmers markets or enjoy better selling space in supermarkets. [Note: Wine producing provinces like Ontario and Quebec, permit direct sales of Canadian wines in their place of production; in British Colombia and Ontario a limited number of off-site private stores has been granted to the wine producers and in Quebec, wine that is bottled in the province, can be sold in grocery stores; a number of provinces also allow the sale of Canadian wine at farmers markets, while sales of EU wines is only possible via the liquor boards. Though the prices in the private outlets are required to be the same as in the liquor boards, some product mark-up are not applied in the private sales outlets resulting in a more lucrative route-to-market available only to domestic wines. CETA includes a commitment to reach mutually agreed solutions on any issues of concern regarding Wines and Spirits, and notably on the discriminatory mark-ups applied in private wine outlets.<br />&bull;&nbsp;Extra cost-of-service charges on imported products, the application of which is not always fully transparent and which are not justified by liquor board;</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;Several liquor boards require their suppliers to guarantee their lowest free-on-board prices in Canada, while one board (Ontario) has decided to retroactively enforce this policy by asking suppliers to refund the board an amount equal to the difference (&lsquo;chargeback&rsquo;).

While in the EU it is easier, imports of EU electronic and fuel burning products into Chile have to go through a burdensome two-step certification procedure. Certificates or tests carried out in the origin country, although valid in Chile, must be completed with tests in Chile which increase the cost for importing goods. This requirement also applies for products certified in their country of origin by internationally recognised laboratories and which are based on international standards, except if a bilateral agreement with a Chilean laboratory exists.</p>\n<p>Any EU laboratory can conclude a such a&nbsp;private bilateral agreement with a laboratory in Chile. These private bilateral agreements are subject to approval by the Chilean competent authority SEC.</p>\n<p>These agreements&nbsp;allow companies&nbsp;to use&nbsp;a simpler system (no.2),&nbsp;so that most&nbsp;tests can be carried out in the country of the producer and not each individual batch has to be certified.</p>\n<p>However,&nbsp;parties cannot be prevented from unilaterally ending the agreements. Also, some tests still need to be carried out in Chile, even in case of a bilateral agreement between laboratories. (There are only few laboratories in Chile.)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>Safety requirements for electronic and fuel products published as Chilean regulations (NCh) are based largely on standards of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC standards).</p>\n<p>In the case of imports, Decree 298/2005 introduced a so-called \"Special Certification System\", which provides for recognition of foreign certificates issued by foreign conformity assessment bodies (CABs). This system consists of a two-step procedure: (1) a \"Resolution\" issued by the Superintendencia de Electricidad y Combustibles (SEC); and (2) a \"Certificate of Approval\" issued by CABs. Moreover, the system requires additional sample testing of a batch, albeit a simplified testing and not for the whole analysis of a product. Only CABs authorised by SEC can provide certificates of approval.</p>\n<p>Chile notified to the WTO amendments to Decree 298/2005 in both 2010 and in 2013 as further modifications were made, to which the EU provided comments at both instances. However, due to the complexity of modernising the bill, the process was suspended in November 2013. Instead, some elements were improved: certificates of conformity no longer require legalisation by the Chilean Consulate in the country of issuance. Another improvement is the possibility to carry out testing by laboratories which are party to the ILAC or IECEE CB schemes. Finally, the Decree mentions the possibility of mutual recognition agreements with third countries, but this option has never been used, nor is it likely to be used in the near future.</p>\n<p>There are still no plans to review the Decree to allow for&nbsp;self-certification by the manufacturer, nor mutual recognition of self-certification by third countries like the EU, as Chile has been underlining at recent meetings of the TBT committee of the EU-Chile Association Agreement.</p>\n<p>In the EU conformity assessment procedure for electronic products is less cumbersome, irrespective of whether the manufacturer is located in the EU or abroad. The manufacturer has only to provide a Supplier&rsquo;s Declaration of Conformity (SDoC), make the technical documentation available and place the \"CE\" marking on the product as proof of compliance with the relevant EC legislation (safety directive for low voltage products (LVD) and the electromagnetic compatibility directive (EMC)). However, in Chile, EU electronic products have to undergo the above mentioned cumbersome procedure that in turn increases the cost for imported goods. Chile has a different system, based in verification by third parties. Self declarations are nor accepted, nor envisaged.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;TBT chapter of the EU Chile Advanced Framework Agreement signed in December 2023 would help improving this issue, when in force.</p>",

Chile&rsquo;s Copyright Law (Law 17.336) was modified in 2010 (Law 20.435) and, although a positive step, it still contains some weaknesses. The reform provides for liability of internet service providers (ISP), increases sanctions, and regulates the extent and scope of private copies. However, it is necessary to strengthen measures against digital piracy and ensure effective action to address illegal content on the internet. A system of notifications by ISPs to subscribers suspected of infringing copyright material came into effect in 2012 and is being used by the six major ISPs representing 95% of the fixed broadband market. The government ran a major public awareness campaign about this system. However the Chilean law requires a court order prior to take down identified content. This system may avoid a certain number of court cases as having to resort to court orders to take-down illegal material from the internet is time consuming and costly. However, the notice and notice system is not suitable for addressing certain forms of copyright infringement, such as stream ripping services or infringements committed via cyberlockers for example. The Chilean law does not include civil or administrative remedies such as website blocking remedies. However economic impact has diminished at least for individual users since there are legal platforms offering a wide range of music and films for subscribers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The modified Copyright Law introduces civil and criminal remedies; rules on liability of online intermediaries; mediation and arbitration procedures; rules on collective management societies; increase in all applicable fines; no discrimination between the physical and the digital environment; higher sanctions for piracy on a commercial scale; a list of exceptions and limitations to copyright.</p>\n<p>Internet piracy occurs most significantly via peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing of infringing content, but also through hosted sites and, increasingly, illegal mobile downloads. However, the Chilean law requires a court order prior to take down of identified content. Chile&rsquo;s amended Copyright Law creates a \"notice and notice\" architecture but lacks the threat of any real consequences for typical online piracy and fails to impute liability upon an ISP that gains knowledge of infringement outside of a court order. The Chilean law provides for no sanctions in case the online intermediary does not give notice to the infringer within the deadline of 5 days.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned factors cause concerns about the effectiveness of the rules providing for the liability of online intermediaries. However, a system of notification to subscribers suspected of infringing copyright came into effect in 2012 and is used by the six major ISPs. The private sector is concerned with the need for the involvement of the judicial system (court order) which is a lengthy and costly process and doubts that the notification system will prove effective in reducing online piracy. However, the notice and notice system is not suitable for addressing certain forms of copyright infringement, such as stream ripping services or infringements committed via cyberlockers for example. The Chilean law does not include civil or administrative remedies such as website blocking remedies. Having to resort to court orders to take down illegal material from the interent is time consuming and costly.</p>\n<p>On enforcement, Chile does not envisage the creation of a specialised enforcement agency on ISP liability or any adoption of implementing regulations thereon. Although there is some good cooperation with Chilean criminal and civil enforcement authorities, additional resources are needed to raise actions and increased prioritization on the part of the judiciary. Police and customs officials take ex officio actions on a regular basis and involve rights holders in legal procedures. However, more enforcement actions would be needed against Internet sites. Prosecutions for copyright crimes are too infrequent and rarely result in deterrent sentencing and civil actions face procedural obstacles and delays.</p>",

In other words, prior voluntary disclosure of innocuous data by the owner made in the interest of transparency can still justify denial of data exclusivity.</p>\n<p>Chile&rsquo;s industrial property law (Art.91(e)), and as reflected in Decree 107, prevent data exclusivity protection if a pharmaceutical or agro-chemical product marketing approval application is filed in Chile after 12 months from the date when the first registration is granted in another country. This is apparently a particularly short deadline for EU companies which may render practically impossible registration and entry on the Chilean market. Although the deadline starts counting from the day of obtaining (and not the filing) the first marketing authorisation internationally, it still is a time limit and not all companies have Chile in their market strategy at the time (e.g., certain virus/the disease may not exist in Chile at the time).</p>\n<p>Moreover, this is particularly difficult for agro-chemicals because it seems that Chile&rsquo;s regulatory requirements for product assessment prevent registrants from meeting the 12 month novelty bar described above. More specifically, before submitting a market approval request, the &ldquo;Servicio Agricola Ganadero&rdquo; (SAG) needs to approve experimental trial protocols and requires submission of local seasonal efficacy trial results. Both regulatory proceedings demand at least 24 months to comply with. Thus, compliance with Chilean regulatory requirements prevents meeting fixed deadlines for data exclusivity protection eligibility.</p>\n<p>In addition, delays in deciding on the grant of IPRs by the Chilean Industrial property Institute (INAPI), including patents, can be significant. Notwithstanding, modifications to Chile&rsquo;s IP system considers changes that should expedite and streamline the patent application process.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On 10 March 2014, the Chilean Service for Agriculture and Livestock (SAG) adopted a regulation on equivalence registry. In order to promote generics, this regulation allows a third party to obtain marketing authorization without submitting test data for molecules without a patent or which do not have data protection. Even if, according to Chilean law, data protection is granted with the application upon request, the company does not receive a document stating that such protection has been required together with the application and the document providing marketing authorization does not confirm that&nbsp; the protection has been granted.&nbsp; This leaves the company that first generated the data without legal documentation to defend itself against third parties registration.</p>",

Difficult for companies to get academic qualifications of their workers recognised. Applications need many notarised documents (e.g. certificates of good conduct of workers, certification of previous projects), which are very difficult to provide for foreign companies. Projects ask for a \"RUT\" - a local tax identification number which is difficult to obtain for foreign companies. Many original documents are needed as part of the registration process for the \"registro de consultores\". This is time consuming, but also difficult for foreign companies that have worked all over the world and may need to present original documents from various countries. Experience of sister companies is not recognised. More transparency in public procurement of public works is needed, in particular at decentralized level.</p>\n<p>This issue was raised at several trade counsellor meetings since 2013 and MAAC since 2014. The EU delegation dialogue with the Ministry of Public works (MOP) and Ministry of Health do not show results so far.

The EU Delegation offered MOP the possibility to use EU funds (TAIEX instrument) to convey EU best practices through capacity building in the public procurement procedures.

        "description": "<p>China often uses trade restrictive measures (export bans, export duties, quotas, licensing requirements) on exports of a broad range of minerals, fertilisers and other key raw materials. These export restrictions affect all companies operating outside China, including EU companies. As a consequence, EU industry is facing difficulties and uncertainty in securing primary raw materials, especially when no alternative source of supply or no alternative raw material is available. Besides export restrictions, the EU industry is also affected by the lack of transparency of regulations and procedures affecting various raw materials (e.g. Fluorspar), as well as some restrictions in investment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Reports also show that discriminatory barriers for the Rare Earth processing industry have been set-up by the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). For example in the Inner Mongolia province, the pre-condition of any company to have their request for a permit evaluated, is that a well-known large local Rare Earths company is given a minimum of 51% share (without any capital investment). This is an unwritten rule that has effectively blocked any new FDI in the sector, even if the foreign companies were to fulfil all the legal requirements to be granted a permit for a processing plant.&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, rare earth mining is still on the negative list for FDI, i.e. in principle off-limits for foreign investors. At the beginning of 2022, China officially set up the China Rare Earth Group Co, an industrial conglomerate, through merging several key producers of the important mineral resources. The state holds a direct 31% stake.<br /> <br /> Raw materials subject to export licensing include notably rare earths, synthetic and natural graphite, gallium and germanium, tungsten, indium, cobalt and magnesium. Export duties have decreased in recent years, but remain in place for, among others, lead and aluminium.<br /> <br /> These restrictions have a significant detrimental impact for raw materials such as rare earths where China supplies &gt; 90% of world demand.</p>\n<p>China&rsquo;s 13% VAT on rare earths is only refundable on processed goods incorporating these raw materials. Similarly, only largely unprocessed rare earth imports (concentrates) are duty-free, whereas 5% import duty + 13% VAT are due on processed rare earth imports. All this to help China&rsquo;s industry to move up the value chain.<br /> <br /> In 2023, China published successively new export controls on gallium &amp; germanium, and graphite. The controls on gallium &amp; germanium and graphite in particular have a scope that is much broader than in customary international practice and are not justified in a detailed rationale based on national security / potential military end-use. These controls may give rise to supply chain disruptions in e.g. semiconductor, EV battery manufacturing and be weaponised for industrial or political coercion. In 2024, China also introduced export controls on antimony.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For additional information on synthetic graphite, please refer to fiche 17542.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The international standards for animal health (WOAH) clearly define conditions to allow safe trade to continue from non-affected areas (regionalisation measures) and on which products can be safely continued to be traded when an outbreak of African swine fever occurs. Upon detection of the virus on its territory, the EU has immediately implemented stringent control measures in the affected areas and implemented regionalisation measures guaranteeing that trade of pigs and pig products can continue to take place under safe conditions. These measures have proven to be effective and are fully in line with international standards. Trading partners (including China) have been provided with detailed information on the stringent EU measures put in place guaranteeing that safe trade can continue to take place.</p>\n<p>As of June 2024, 9&nbsp;EU Member States&nbsp;were authorised to export pork to China : Austria; Denmark; Finland; France;&nbsp;Ireland;&nbsp; Netherland, Spain; Portugal and Belgium since January 2024.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However this opening of market access to Belgian pork does not mean that China starts recognising the EU regionalisation measures in place (and based on international WOAH standards) since BE is ASF-free.</p>\n<p>China has not lifted the (unjustified) national bans imposed on various EU Member States facing ASF outbreaks and despite&nbsp;the strict EU regionalisation measures in place in those EU MS&nbsp;(like Germany for instance which cannot export pork to China since October 2020)</p>\n<p>The EU considers that the various country-wide bans imposed by China are overly trade restrictive and not in line with international standards, neither with the requirements under the WTO SPS Agreement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In practice China's approach to regionalisation is to discuss bilaterally with indvidual selected EU MS, rather than engaging with Commission at EU level.

According to the annual DG TAXUD statistics, roughly 90% of all counterfeit goods seized at European borders come every year from China, including Hong Kong. This phenomenon goes beyond lost revenues of IP stakeholders since a significant part of detained articles are products for daily use that could be potentially dangerous to the health and safety of consumers.</p>\n<p>Even though significant legislative progress has been made during recent years, IPR protection and enforcement are in many areas still not sufficiently effective. Lengthy registration proceedings and the burdensome legalisation of foreign documents are on-going problems. Substantial concerns exist in particular as regards the low quality standard required for innovation patent and as regards the IPR protection provided for data protection and trade secrets.</p>\n<p>Enforcement remains a very serious concern. Despite noteworthy efforts made by China, the access to the Chinese administrative and judicial enforcement system in China remains problematic for EU companies, notably for SMEs. In particular, notarisation and legalisation requirements make the defence of IPRs difficult and time-consuming for foreign right holders. Moreover, interim injunctions are difficult to obtain in practice, the damages awarded by the Courts remain often too low, and the execution of judicial decisions is burdensome. In some cases, signs of selective IPR enforcement are detected when state-owned enterprises or strategic areas are concerned.</p>\n<p>In addition, the EU industry suffers from a long-standing discrepancy between the federal and the provincial protection level in China in terms of enforcement effectiveness and efficiency. The recent central anti-corruption campaigns and the creation of specific IPR Courts in&nbsp;various cities&nbsp;give hope for a more harmonized level of protection in the future.</p>\n<p>Online counterfeiting and piracy have aggravated the enforcement situation. Potential clients of such goods are now only a mouse-click away from having direct access to them at a global level. The delivery of goods in small consignments makes effective customs control impossible. Major Chinese players, such as Alibaba, are increasingly concerned about their reputation (particularly after having been named and shamed in US 301 reports) and take pro-active measures, without however being able to get the problem under control.</p>\n<p>Somewhat related is the active policy of&nbsp;China to make EU&nbsp;companies not exert or even transfer their IP rights as condition to be allowed of having access to the Chinese market. The objective to take over foreign technology in key industrial areas is documented in many Chinese planning documents,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;\"Made in China 2025\" and five year plans. The ways to make companies obey to unnecessary disclosure and licensing requirements are manifold, such as procurement, standard setting, joint ventures, business registration procedures.</p>\n<p>Since 2020, we have observed that Chinese tribunals introduced anti-suit injunctions in disputes involving telecommunication patents. These extraterritorial measures put European firms at a disadvantage and prevents them from protecting their legitimate interests.</p>\n<p>Issues were raised in the IP Working Group in November 2022 (next session in 2023), and in October 2022 the IP Key China project was restarted for 3 years.

The draft standard will therefore overestimate the impact of natural substances normally present in wood but underestimate the impact of toxic substances.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The volume-based approach to the testing method used in the draft Chinese standard would make the final emission of the product depend on the design and functions (for example number of drawers) rather than the choice of raw material.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>UPDATE March 2023</em>: The mandatory standard for volatile organic compounds limits on furniture has been modified and was submitted to MIIT for final technical review end of 2022. The standard is expected to be released soon. SAC/TC480 (furniture), have called for comments on this standard twice and improved the text based on domestic and overseas comments. No major objection from EU Companies was raised since then.</p>\n<p><em>UPDATE November 2023: </em>At the WTO TBT Committee in November,&nbsp;China confirmed that all comments were analysed and work on the amended standard continues and will finalise soon. However, China could not indicate when the new standard would be ready for publication.

Foreign Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) might be forced to disclose all their key technologies to the Joint Venture (JV).</p>\n<p><em>UPDATE November 2023</em>: The 2017 MIIT NEV Production and Products access Regulation (MIIT Decree 39) was revised in 2020. Requirements that the newly established NEV manufacturer has to have R&amp;D capability and own key technology were deleted: for newly established JV, foreign OEMs&rsquo; mother company is not obliged to transfer technology to JV. They can sell or transfer technology if they want. However, MIIT Production and Products Access Regulation for ALL Road Motor Vehicles (MIIT Decree 50), which was issued in 2018. It applies to all kinds of Road Motor Vehicles. Requirement such as the obligation for newly established OEMs to have R&amp;D capability remains. There are some conflicts between MIIT Decree 39 and Decree 50. From 1.1. 2022, theoretically speaking foreign company could establish 100% owned manufacturing facility in China, as shown by the example of Tesla. This implies that with or without the barrier, there is no problem for companies like Tesla to establish 100% foreign owned plant in China. For newly established JV, most international &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; manufacturers (European) do not have valuable electrical vehicle technology that could be of interest to China. However, the EUCCC PP 2023/2024 points to lack of transparency and equal treatment in policy implementation.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Despite recent developments in the Chinese public procurement regulatory framework, the main problem remains an active Buy Chinese policy where, in principle, only Chinese companies are allowed to bid in public tenders and foreign ones are only allowed under certain conditions. Government agencies and related entities are required to purchase equipment and technology from Chinese state or privately owned manufacturing companies. There is limited access to public tenders and insufficient transparency of all public tenders. This barrier is related to the enforcement of the Government Procurement Law (GPL) and the Bidding Law. Central and local entities tend to implement in a very broad manner those provisions, going far beyond discriminations imposed by the law.In addition, the review mechanism for bids is deficient.</p>\n<p>The Buy Chinese principle covers all sectors, with most market access problems reported in the medical device sector. The policies range from pre-market R&amp;D support to local government health authorities encouraging procurement of domestic equipment. In addition, the&nbsp;Made in China 2025&nbsp;policy sets targets for domestic medical devices market shares. In practical terms, we also observe difficulties in accessing the public procurement market by products manufactured in China by foreign invested companies.</p>\n<p>Also, the renewable energy (RE) market in China is dominated by SOEs. Foreign companies face market-access barriers from regulations (e.g. data transfer) as well as non-market practices in the allocation of quotas.</p>\n<p>In addition, China has not yet undertaken any substantial multilateral or bilateral commitment concerning government procurement. It submitted its WTO GPA (Government Procurement Agreement) initial offer end of December 2007, and subsequently several revised offers. However, despite some progress made, the most recent offer does not provide sufficient coverage of entities, and has many exceptions.</p>\n<p>Another issue with wide repercussions on the public procurement field is the implementation of the accreditation procedure for the indigenous innovative procurement scheme. A joint Circular of MOF, MOST and NDRC was issued in September 2009, detailing accreditation procedures to be followed in order to be eligible to tendering procedures. Among the requirements, IPR had to have Chinese origin (e.g. separate existence of brands and the obligation to have R&amp;D related to the IP included in the products located in China), requirement to disclose information related to innovation and IPR, thus exceeding by far standard demands for eligibility to government schemes. A notice issued by the State Council in November 2011, directing all government entities to remove any mention of linkage between indigenous innovation policy and government procurement incentive measures within regulatory documents and to stop such implementation by 1st December 2011. Despite the efforts made the linkage remain a problem as this policy is still applied at sub central level in some of China&rsquo;s provinces.</p>\n<p>In light of China's work towards accession to the WTO GPA, EU<strong>&nbsp;</strong>expects China to already&nbsp;<u>now</u>&nbsp;ensure EU companies non-discriminatory access and participation to the Chinese procurement market. Importantly,&nbsp;<em>State Council Document No. 5 (2017) </em>clearly stated that products manufactured by foreign enterprises in China will be treated equally in public procurement bids.&nbsp; This was confirmed&nbsp;in 2019 by article 16 of&nbsp; the <em>Foreign Investment Law</em> and also in a more specific manner by the <em>State Council Circular 39</em> of 12 August 2019, instructing various government bodies and agencies to inspect unreasonable restrictions faced by foreign-invested and private enterprises in bidding process by September 2019 and abolishing regulations and practices in government procurement processes that impede fair competition.</p>\n<p>For the specific medical device sector, in a reply letter to DG TRADE on 17 Jan. 2020, <strong>MOFCOM</strong> states that \"domestic brands\" means products manufactured within the territory of China, rather than those produced by Chinese companies.\" and that&nbsp;\"The Chinese government has taken constant efforts to optimise the business environment and will treat products made in China by foreign-invested enterprises in a fair and equal manner during the bidding process of government procurement.\"&nbsp;EU/EU industry to monitor in case there other cases of discrimination in tendering processes against EU FIEs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>UPDATE November 2023</em>: Still in place. Government procurement law, published July 2022 (https://www.pkulaw.com/en_law/a089c7cf0520342ebdfb.html) stipulates that \"Government procurements shall be based on the procurement of domestic goods, projects and services with the exception of the certain circumstances\". Both the Government Procurement Law and the Bidding Law are currently under revision (calls for comments have expired, but revised and final laws are still pending). Foreign Investment Law (FIL), forbids discriminatory treatment of foreign companies in procurement. Article 16 of FIL stipulates: &ldquo;The State guarantees that foreign-invested enterprises participate in government procurement activities through fair competition in accordance with the law. Products produced and services provided by foreign-invested enterprises in China shall be treated equally according to law in government procurement activities.&rdquo; Issue of access to pubic procurement by foreign companies are regularly raised in the dialogue(s) with China (see also fiche 14587). In the renewable energy sector, EUCCC also reports that due to preferences to domestic producers, foreign players in the wind power industry - for instance - face a bidding gap of up to 40% in public tenders. in addition, public procurement processes tend to favour domestic manufacturers and take exclusively into consideration environmental records in China.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The issue of access to public procurement by foreign companies is regularly raised in the dialogue(s) with China (more lately at the High-level Economic and Trade Dialogue in September 2023.)</p>",

        "description": "<p>In December 2013, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information (MIIT) issued the Chinese Shipbuilding Scrapping &amp; Newbuilding Subsidy Programme. The scheme is endowed with <strong>&euro;19,5 billion RMB</strong> (according to SEA Europe) and was originally running until 2015. It was later extended until 2017<strong>. </strong>While it may since have been discontinued, as of January 2019 the Chinese authorities&nbsp;had not&nbsp;provided definitive confirmation of this despite EU requests, while some EU industry participants believe it is still operating. There are no official data available on the exact figures and conditions of the scheme.</p>\n<p>The <strong>objective</strong> indicated by the Chinese authorities is to phase out obsolete vessels and replace them by more energy efficient ships and, thus, protect the environment/climate and enhance their fleet's safety standards.</p>\n<p><strong>Beneficiaries </strong>receive a subsidy of 1500 RMB/GT &ndash; 50% is paid on scrapping the old vessel (1-10 years before their mandatory retirement age), 50% on ordering the new vessel. According to the \"Administration of Central Government Subsidies for the Scrapping of Outdated Ships and Single-hulled Oil Tankers and the Rebuilding of New Ships\" Cai Jian (2014) no 24 the gross tonnage of the newly-built ships should be at least equivalent to that of the disassembled vessels. However, at the EU-China Shipbuilding Dialogue 2014 in Shanghai, MIIT declared that there is no automatic link between scrapping and newbuilding. The vessels must be registered in China and the newbuilding has to take place on a Chinese shipyard. A list of qualified Chinese shipyards entitled to participate was published. The main beneficiaries of the programme are the four state owned shipowners: COSCO, CSG, SINOTRANS-Chang Jing and China Merchant. Foreign equipment manufacturers are apparently allowed to participate subject to complying with certain conditions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Conditions for foreign equipment manufacturers:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>the percentage of \"local\" marine equipment must be at least 70%;</li>\n<li>\"local\" supply refers only to manufacturing companies. Sales offices of a foreign marine equipment supplier do not qualify as local suppliers;</li>\n<li>wholly foreign owned manufacturing companies established in China do not qualify as local suppliers either;</li>\n<li>in case of Joint Ventures, the Chinese partner has to be the major shareholder.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These restrictions do not appear to have&nbsp;been written down in any formal document. At the EU-China Shipbuilding Dialogue 2014, MIIT declared to have no influence on sourcing maritime equipment. It would be the shipowner's decision. Accordingly, the local content policy is implemented through an arrangement between the shipowner, the shipyard and China Classification Society (CCS) by means of a list of equipment. This not publicly available list attributes a weighting factor to each major component (i.e. 38,5% is attributed to the engines) for calculation of the 70% local content. As a result, a European engine manufacturer can never sell engines to these subsidized ships, regardless of whether they have factories in China or not.</p>\n<p>In spite of investment liberalisation in 2022, with the review of the catalogue of encouraged industries for foreign investment (design and application of clean energy in particular), issues faced by EU maritme manufacturing concern difficulties to accessing China's green maritime demonstration zones and incentives, as well as contributing to standard setting organisations.</p>",

In particular: (a) with the \"buy China policy\" central ministries issue official guidelines and use informal practices to direct local procurement auhtorities towards favouring domestic equipment manufacturers and discriminate imported products; (b) medical devices procurement often include conditions that require or pressure technology transfer to Chinese entities; (c) China&rsquo;s expanding application of VBP (Volume Based Procurement) for medical devices also creates an unfair competitive environment.</p>\n<p>Public government documents show an awareness of and preference for using VBP to increase the market share of domestic producers of medical devices.&nbsp; VBP operates without sufficient transparency and is increasingly promoting a low-cost, lower-quality commodity market, thereby concentrating market power in a few Chinese companies that can, with government financial support, meet the unreasonably low price requirements under VBP.&nbsp; In some cases, foreign companies have offered low enough bids to be selected, but this comes at little to no profit, in order to maintain their presence in China&rsquo;s market, when they do not end up abandoning the China market altogether.This policy is supported by actions from different ministries and continues to expand.</p>\n<p>Finally, the lack of a clear legal definition for &ldquo;domestic product&rdquo; allows government procurement authorities to interpret the term in a variety of ways.&nbsp; As a result, our companies report that they are often excluded from public procurement consideration even when they manufacture in China. Local bids often include explicit exclusion of imported products from the tender. Such measures and practices that significantly lack transparency and discriminate against foreign products appear to run counter to the obligations of transparency and non-discrimination under paragraphs 2(C)1 and 3(a) of Part I of China&rsquo;s Protocol of Accession to the WTO and paragraph 1 of Article X of the GATT 1994, as well as Article 16 of the Foreign Investment Law, Article 15 of the Regulations for Implementing the Foreign Investment Law (State Council Order No. 723), and other relevant laws and regulations in China, such as Notice 35, which the MOF issued in October 2021, and which reiterates China&rsquo;s previous commitment in the Foreign Investment Law to treat products produced by foreign-invested companies in China equal to those produced by domestic companies in the public procurement context.&nbsp; They also appear in tension with Article 4 (national treatment and non-discrimination) of the WTO&rsquo;s Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), which China is currently in negotiation to join.&nbsp; China&rsquo;s measures and practices raise doubts about China&rsquo;s readiness to comply with obligations of international agreements, such as the GPA, that China aspires to join.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

        "description": "<p>The financial services market in mainland China is heavily regulated and suffers from a number of distortions with capital in- and outflows being controlled. The market is very clearly dominated by domestic, mostly state-owned firms. Historically, access to the market was difficult for foreign investors with equity caps and similar measures in place that significantly limited access. Among the small footprint of international banks and similar financial services, US companies are dominating with UK investments in second place and the EU footprint in banking probably limited to only <em>ca</em>. 0.1 &ndash; 0.2% of the reported 1.2% overall foreign banking market share. (The reservation applies that methodologies to quantify this market share can vary and will lead to different results.)</p>\n<p>Beyond banking, China is an important market for EU insurance and re-insurance companies. Whilst the total assets under management by foreign banks stood at <em>ca</em>. EUR 440 bn in 2019 and hence almost double as high as comparable figures for the insurance industry, the foreign market share is with 7.8% significantly higher than in banking. (Similar reservations apply as for banking.)</p>\n<p>Starting with policy announcements back in November 2017, China has gradually introduced nearly 20 or so distinct measures that partly opened up its banking sector to greater access on the part of international investors.</p>\n<p>One should also note that whilst accessing China&rsquo;s financial services sector has become easier for outside investment, this does not amount to an international integration of China&rsquo;s financial services market or its banking system. Indeed, the Chinese government has maintained controls on capital flows as well as interest and exchange rates.</p>\n<p>Despite mentioned policy of opening up the financial services sector there remain a number of market access restrictions in place, some of which are of a de jure nature and whilst falling short of discriminating against FIEs create a disparate impact for them. Other such hurdles are more of a de facto nature as in e.g. slow and to some extent opaque licensing procedures.</p>\n<p>Of the various still existing such restrictions some pertinent current market access hurdles are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Market access for European banks to underwrite foreign government bonds</li>\n<li>Future extension of the &ldquo;Carbon Emissions Reduction Framework Facility&rdquo; by the central bank to also include European banks</li>\n<li>Maintenance of leasing companies&rsquo; ability to operate nationwide in light of possibly restrictions due to draft &ldquo;Regulations on Local Financial Supervision and Administration&rdquo; circulated by the central bank</li>\n<li>Extension of cross-border borrowing to consumer finance companies</li>\n<li>Different interpretations of some prudential ratios (liquidity and deposit deviation ratio)</li>\n<li>Maintenance of effective access to Shanghai Clearing House for EU banks</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Further issues that are industry concerns relate to licensing procedures particularly in insurance service (which are cumbersome, do usually not allow for parallel submissions of applications to open up business in several Chinese Provinces, and are in part opaque in their local implementation) as well as certain aspects of macro-prudential assessment policies.</p>\n<p><em>UPDATE March 2023</em>: Still largely in place. A comparatively heavy approach to regulation and a significant number of market distortions, which can give advantage to domestic firms, are unchanged. Market access restrictions remain de jure in some parts of the market, whilst in others regulation is done with China's own large, state-owned banks in mind leading to de facto barriers to access in some cases.</p>\n<p>Market access in financial services has been addressed at the 2022 HED (19 July). In detail, access on the part of EU financial institutions invested in China to the central bank's \"Carbon Emissions Reduction Facility\" (CERF, a facility offering re-financing at below market rates for loans to green projects) was addressed and since granted to at least two EU banks. Further, the Chinese side committed to modifying a draft regulation that would have severely limited the geographical scope for leasing companies so to preserve the status quo.</p>",

Following the Cybersecurity Law, the CAC issued the Measures for Cybersecurity Review in April 2020 (the \"<strong>2020 Measures</strong>\"). On July 10, 2021, the CAC issued the Draft Measures, expanding the application scope of the cybersecurity review to cover data processors, if data processors' activities affect or may affect national security. The New Measures follows the expanded application scope under the Draft Measures, although it refers to network platform operators instead of data processors. Under the New Measures, both CIIOs and network platform operators need to pay attention whether their business activities may be subject to cybersecurity review in China.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Another round of consultations was organised in August 2019, and the law was passed in October 2019, with a enter into force date on 1 January 2020. Regulations to implement the law have partially been released.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The law is overly broad in scope, covering areas ranging from research and commercial use, import, export as well as certification. The EU notes that it aims at regulating all these use cases of cryptography, whereas in most other parts of the world most such use cases of cryptography are unregulated and left to the market, which corresponds also to best practices as recomended by the World Semiconductor Council (WSC) and adapted by the Government/Authorities Meeting on Semiconductors (GAMS).<br /><br />Most of ICT products use some elements of encryption, but most are not dedicated primarily to encryption. The latter products (which, for instance, use cryptography as a feature for digital signatures, authentication or verifying product authenticity) are in general not subject to licensing requirements or any similar regulatory constraints. To strike a balance between security and industry development and ensure that the law is not more trade restrictive than necessary, the EU suggests narrowly defining the kind of cryptography products falling under it, and, in line with SCA's (then OSCCA&rsquo;s) so-called Year 2000 Clarification, ensuring that only such products fall under it the core function of which is encryption. This provision is missing in the approved law. Related, implementing regulations released so far (Commercial Cryptography Administrative Regulations, in draft) have maintained and reinforced the overly broad application of the law.<br /><br /></p>",

Designed to secure critical Chinese infrastructure information systems, the initial MLPS is a framework that classifies information systems physically located in China according to their relative impact on national security, social order, and economic interests if the system is damaged or attacked. The classification levels range from one to five, one being the least critical and five being the most critical.

        "country": "Dominican Republic",
        "description": "<p>Since beginning of 2018 the General Directorate of Internal Taxes (DGII) of the Dominican Republic has been developing a traceability system (known as Sistema Trafico) to tackle very high rates of illicit trade and tax evasion in the sector of alcoholic beverages and cigarettes (40% in 2018). The initiative was supported by the Association of Industries of the Dominican Republic, mainly concerned with protection of national rum producers, affected by smuggled/adulterated produce. The system will be applicable to all alcoholic beverages and cigarettes (domestic and imported), establishing control and traceability of each product marketed in the Dominican Republic from their initial production to final consumption. The main feature of the system will be the compulsory labelling of each bottle, containing a unique code and serial number, as well as special authentication marks to prevent fraud. The final consumer will also be able to scan the code with a special application for mobile phones. National producers of alcoholic beverages (mainly rum and beer) with higher volumes of production will be able to integrate the labelling process in their production lines, so that the labelling will be done automatically. Importers will need to place the label manually on each bottle. It is not clear where this process would take place (at origin or at destination).</p>\n<p>The system still lacks implementing regulations and is only based on Art. 17 of the recently adopted Law 17-19 on the Eradication of Illicit Trade, which empowers regulatory bodies to establish traceability systems for inputs and finished products to prevent smuggling and tax evasion.</p>\n<p>The System has been developed by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), entrusted with the tendering process. The tender was awarded to the Swiss company SICPA in April 2019 who will be the provider, developer and implementer of the system. It was supposed to be ready by November 2019 for alcoholic beverages, however, to date it has not been integrated in the system of the Customs Administration (Integrated Customs Management System SIGA).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The national alcoholic beverage production sector has been granted a series of facilities to implement the new system. SICPA, the company that won the contract for the implementation of Trafico, must install the marking equipment directly on the automatic and semi-automatic production lines. Therefore, the equipment and processes vital to comply with the requirements of the System by the local production will be fully covered by the supplier.</p>\n<p>For imported products, indirect marking (adhesives) should be used, which may be applied at origin or in the Dominican Republic. The costs associated with the adaptation of the software for the printing system as well as the necessary machinery must be covered by the importer. Therefore, contrasting the conditions under which the importing sector must implement the Trafico System with the facilities granted to the national producer sector, there is a clear disadvantage that will negatively affect the competitiveness of the imported product in the national market.</p>",

Thus, under the Articles 11 and 22 of the Customs Law 66/1963, amended by Law 95/2005 it is set that an ad valorem tariff will be paid on the declared value, namely the real value of the goods plus the related costs.</p>\n<p>However, the Egyptian customs authorities do not always comply with this principle and customs valuation is being carried out on a discretionary basis. Likewise, the authorities reject the value declared in the commercial invoice whereas there is a discrepancy in the HS code of the imported good, against merchandises usually encoded with a higher tariff. In addition, as it is the case, a fine of the same value of the levied tariff is applied and has to be paid by the operators.</p>\n<p>Customs authorities in Egypt refuse recognizing importers&acute; commercial invoice, even if sealed by the Chamber of Commerce in the country of origin.</p>\n<p>There is also s specific side of this practice: the <strong>valuation uplifts for spare parts under service contracts</strong>. The EU was alerted to the fact that Egypt applies a 50% value uplift to all shipments of spare parts as a result of reference to 'internet pricing'. As this concerns spare parts for service contract support, there is no commercial transaction and the hardware is supplied free of charge (under warranty). Such shipments cannot be declared at a transaction value of zero, therefore they should be declared using an alternative valuation methodology, i.e. the sixth valuation method (&ldquo;fallback&rdquo;), in accordance with the regulation of the valuation agreement of the World Trade Organization and article 27 of Decree 10/2006 of the Executive Regulations for the Egyptian Customs Law No. 66 of 1963. The 50% uplift based on unauthorized sources (&lsquo;internet pricing&rsquo;) provides no legitimate basis for comparison with or evaluation of actual declared import values and has no connection to the importer. While the Egyptian law does provide for an opportunity to have the goods released under protest (based on article 31 of Decree 10/2006 mentioned above), this implies an increased cost in tariffs as the result of a non-WTO compliant valuation.</p>",

        "country": "India",
        "description": "<p>Over a period of time, India has been trying to bring more and more steel products under the mandatory certification scheme operated by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). These products are covered under different Steel and Steel Products (Quality Control) Orders. Initially, BIS brought 20 products under the mandatory certification scheme. Subsequently, 18 products were added through different Orders taking the total number of products to 38. The BIS certification procedure adds to additional burden and costs for EU steel companies for obtaining certification, which implies additional tests for products, which have already been tested.</p>\n<p>India on 13 August 2018, came out with the Steel and Steel Products (Quality Control) Order, 2018 wherein it notified 54 products. One standard (IS 7904:1995) cease to exist after 18 November 2018.&nbsp;5 standards (IS 4454 (Part I) : 2001, IS 4454 (Part II) : 2001, IS 4824 : 2006, IS 11169 (Part I) : 1984 and IS 6603 : 2001) have been kept outside the purview of this Order till 17 February 2019 and IS 7904 : 2017 shall come into effect from 19.2.2019.</p>\n<p>All the steel and steel products were consolidated and notified under the Steel and Steel Products (Quality Control) Order 2020. which targets 145 steel and steel products. The QCOs for majority of these products are already in force. However, it remains unclear to the EU which of Quality Control Orders for steel products are already in force. India defers from time-to-time the date of implementation of certain steel products.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>India&nbsp;explained at the WTO TBT Committee that the BIS standards are required in order to take into account local manufacturing practices of India and, therefore, international standards are not sufficient.</p>\n<p>Not only does India impose BIS-specific standards, in addition, testing is to be performed locally (BIS recognised labs): India should at least accept that tests can be carried out in foreign accredited laboratories attesting compliance with ISO standards (or BIS Indian standards) thus not requiring local testing in India for all types of steel products, and not to conduct factory inspections in the EU steel mills having in place a quality management system as defined in ISO 9001.</p>\n<p>The recently issued list of accredited laboratories (11th October 2017) does not include any laboratories outside of India.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the QCOs require physical audit by an auditor of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) in order for products manufactured in third countries to receive the approval for exports to India. The on-going COVID-19 pandemic and international travel restrictions linked thereto have negative impact on certification process in India, especially for foreign companies with production facilities outside India. &nbsp;The EU would also like to support the introduction of virtual/remote inspection for BIS conformity assessment in the steel sector. Alternative inspection methods are crucial to maintain access to Indian market.</p>\n<p>The Technical Division of the Ministry of Steel through an Order dated 6th February 2023, extended the date of enforcement for Ferronickel by 6 months to 23 July 2023.&nbsp;The product falls under the Steel and Steel Products (Quality Control) Order 2020 dated 22&nbsp;December 2020. This was further extended to 23 January 2024 by an Order dated 25 July 2023.</p>\n<p>As per the Monthly Summary for January 2023 released by the Ministry of Steel, there are 144 Indian Standards on steel and steel products that are in force.</p>\n<p>From time to time, EU makes supporting Statement on QCO on Steel and Steel Products at the TBT Committee meeting.</p>\n<p>On 26&nbsp;October 2023, the Technical Division of the Ministry of Steel issued a Circular stating that all steel importers importing steel without BIS license need to mandatorily apply and seek clarification from Ministry of Steel through QCO Portal for each and every imported steel consignment.</p>\n<p>To streamline the implementation of the QCOs, the Ministry of Steel had constituted a Technical Committee for examination and analysis of the application(s) received for issuance of clarification, whether the product(s) which are being imported without BIS certification are covered under Steel QCO or not.</p>\n<p>According to the Circular, the Ministry of Steel issues clarification for each single import consignment. In this regard, it is further clarified that for each and every consignment, the importer needs to submit fresh application through TCQCO Portal, unless stated otherwise in the clarification issued.</p>\n<p>Through the Steel and Steel Products (Quality Control) Order 2020, Ministry of Steel has been issuing QCOs to widen the scope of coverage to add more grades of steel and related products.</p>\n<p>On 5 February 2024, India notified&nbsp;Steel and Steel Products (Quality Control) Order 2024&nbsp;in&nbsp;supersession of the Steel and Steel Products (Quality Control) Order, 2020, dated 22 December, 2020. In total 157 products were notified under the new Order.&nbsp;&nbsp;This Order shall apply to steel and steel products specified in column (3) of Schedule 1 and&nbsp;goods or articles specified in column (2) of Schedule 2 of this Order.</p>\n<p>On 29 August 2024, India notified&nbsp;Steel and Steel Products (Quality Control) Order 2024&nbsp;in&nbsp;supersession of the Steel and Steel Products (Quality Control) Order, 2024, dated 5 February, 2024. In total 152 products were notified, of which, entry into force of 3 products is foreseen for 8 November 2024.</p>\n<p>In the recently announced Budget 2024-25, India reduced Basic Customs Duty (BCD) on Ferro-nickel from 2.5% to Nil. Similarly, India extended Nil import duty on Ferrous Scrap and Certain specified raw materials for manufacture of CRGO Steel till 31 March 2026.</p>",

The potential threat of compulsory licenses and patent revocations, and the narrow patentability criteria under the India Patents Act, burden companies across different sectors. Moreover, patent applicants continue to confront costly and time-consuming pre- and post-grant oppositions, long waiting periods to receive patent approval, and excessive reporting requirements</li>\n<li>Unclear scope of the Sept 2016 Office Memorandum concerning Section 31D of the Copyright Act: broadcasting vs. streaming.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;As for <u>IPR enforcement</u>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delays in registration of patents, GIs and trademarks, due to cumbersome procedures and limited manpower by IPR authorities;</li>\n<li>Widespread piracy in the sectors of video gaming, music and movie industry; custom authority lacking skills and resources to fight infringments</li>\n<li>Weak IPR enforcement, with insufficient action by relevant authorities to fight IPR infringements;</li>\n<li>Backlogs in Civil Courts for IPR cases: The Commercial Courts Act, enacted in 2015 and amended in 2018, was established to help reduce delays and increase expertise in judicial IP matters.&nbsp; However, to date, only a limited number of courts have benefited under the Act.&nbsp; Rights holders report that jurisdictional challenges have reduced the effectiveness of the commercial courts, and that inadequate resources for staffing and training continue.</li>\n<li>Large number of locally produced infringing goods especially regarding patents and trademarks in the pharmaceutical : Indian law does not protect against unfair commercial use, nor against the unauthorized disclosure of undisclosed test or other data submitted to the government during the application for market approval of pharmaceutical or agrochemical products.</li>\n<li>There is no statutory protection of trade secrets in India, which creates uncertainty for businesses needing to secure sensitive information exchanged between parties.&nbsp; Protection and enforcement of trade secrets is challenging as there are no civil or criminal laws in India that specifically address their protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>On July 23, 2021, India&rsquo;s Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Commerce (DRPSCC), presented its 161st Report on &ldquo;Review of the Intellectual Property Rights Regime in India&rdquo;.&nbsp; The Report emphasizes that the IPR regime should be in compliance with international agreements, rules and norms, and be compatible with those of other nations and foreign entities.&nbsp; While many of the recommendations in the Report are welcomed, some recommendations, such as those relating to compulsory licenses and online broadcasting, raise serious concerns and are regarded as problematic for IP rights holders.</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<p>Through Notification No. 12/2015-2020 dated 12 June 2020, the Indian Government decided to impose curbs on imports of certain new pneumatic tyres used in motor cars, busses, lorries and motorcycles in a move to promote domestic manufacturing, at a time of economic difficulties due to the COVID 19 crisis. The decision changes the import policy of new pneumatic tyres from free to restricted.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Putting the goods under restricted category means that an importer would now require a license or permission from the DGFT for its imports. This further measure has the immediate effect of temporarily closing the market for European exports to the country, before importers are granted a license.</p>\n<p>The procedure to obtain the licence has not been published in its entirety notably the licensing authority requires supplementary information from tyre manufacturers which is additional to the published proceedure. Furthermore, the guidelines for license allocation have also not been published. No transitional period for application of licenses was granted.</p>\n<p>According to the General Guidelines Regarding Imports and Exports, when the imports are subject to authorisation, the &ldquo;actual user alone may import such good(s) unless actual user condition is specifically dispensed with by DGFT&rdquo; (Art. 2.10). The definition of &ldquo;<em>Actual user&rdquo; </em>is given in another document (here, Chapter 9.03). However, in the case of tyres, it appears impossible to comply with such criteria.</p>\n<p>On 17 November 2020, a joint letter signed by Ambassadors of EU and MSs ((FR, IT, DE, CZ and PL) was sent to Mr. Piyush Goyal, Minister of Commerce and Industry. So far, we have had no response from Minister Goyal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Subsequently, jointly with same group of MSs Commercial Counsellors, the Delegation on 21 January 2021 organised a meeting with Additional Director General of Foreign Trade Hardeep Singh. Issues faced by OEMs and tyre manufacturers were explained to him. After listening to the concerns, Mr. Singh stated that licences are being issued and delays have been significantly reduced. All OEMs are getting the licenses requested. DGFT did not agree to our request for guidelines and conveyed that the published form was sufficient. Additionally, they shared that if any company/MS has a specific concern, they should approach them bilaterally and assured EU its support. The EU and Member States agreed to continue to engage with DGFT in this regard.</p>\n<p>The issue of licensing requirement for imports of tyres was raised by EVP Valdis Dombrovskis with Minister Piyush Goyal at the High Level Dialogue (HLD) meeting on 5.2.2021. Unfortunately, India was not willing to find a positive solution to the issue.</p>\n<p>A meeting with the Director General of DGFT was held on this issues on 4 May 2022, unfortunately, no concrete result came out from the meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On 2&nbsp;August 2023, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) announced the fresh Guidelines for Tyre Manufacturers. The details, however, are not yet known as the attached paper released by the DPIIT says that the specific details are available with the concerned division of DPIIT. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>As per the paper, the proposed fresh guidelines have been proposed considering the overall growth of the Indian tyre industry. However, India has put a condition that manufacturers should commit to invest in India in brownfield or greenfield projects for manufacturing tyres. The condition put by India that companies should invest in brownfield or greenfield projects is clearly in the direction towards Make in India.</p>\n<p>The guidelines were never put in public domain.</p>",

        "country": "India",
        "description": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">India planned to introduce security testing of telecommunication equipment since 2017. Facing the risk of disruption of the supply chain, the government postponed the onset of the measures several times, until announcing to finally launch it on 1 October 2019 (wireline and radio equipment) in Phase-I. Phase-II was brought into force from 1 October 2020 for transmission terminal equipment (SDH Equipment, Multiplexing Equipment), PON family of broadband equipment (PON ONT, PON OLT and PON ONU), Feedback Devices. Then from 11 October 2021, phase-III and phase-IV of the Manadatory Testing and Certification of Telecom Equipment was brought in force. Products included under Phase- III are Base station for cellular network, repeater for cellular network, compact cellular network, smart/CCTV camera, smart watch, smart electricity meter, tracking device, IoT gateway, end point device for environmental monitoring and equipment operating in 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz band. Products included under Phase-IV are Transmission terminal equipment (DWDM, DXC), optical fibre (single mode), satellite communication equipment, radio broadcaster receiver, mobile radio trunking system, HF radio, VHF/UHF Radio system Equipment, PTP PMP Microwave Fixed Radio Systems, IP Security Equipment, Router, LAN Switch, Precision Timing Protocol Grand Master Equipment, IP Multi Media Conferencing Equipment, Mobility Management Entity (MME) and Point of Sale Devices. While the date of Phase-III and Phase-IV coming into force is same, the dates of the certification becoming mandatory are different: 1 July 2022 (Phase-III), 1 February 2022 (Phase-IV - EMI/EMC and Safety) and 1 July 2022 (Phase-IV - Remaining ER parameters). Products included under Phase-V are Base station for cellular network for 5G, 5G Core, hypervisor, e band fixed radio delay systems, Converged Multi Service Application Access Equipment (C-MSAAE), IP Terminal, Hybrid Set Top box, for which mandatory certification requirement comes into force on 1 July 2024.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The date of implementation of Phase-III and Phase-IV was initially postponed to 1 July 2023 on request of the industry citing reasons that Phase-III and Phase-IV implementation could impact the 5G launch in India. This was pushed multiple times, first to 1 October 2023 for selected products, later to 1 January 2024 for 32 products (<a href=\"https://www.tec.gov.in/pdf/MTCTE/MTCTE_Amd_Notif.pdf\">https://www.tec.gov.in/pdf/MTCTE/MTCTE_Amd_Notif.pdf</a>), followed by a revised deadline of 1 April 2024 for 12 products (<a href=\"https://www.tec.gov.in/pdf/MTCTE/extension%20for%2012%20products.pdf\">https://www.tec.gov.in/pdf/MTCTE/extension%20for%2012%20products.pdf</a>), and a further revision to 1 August 2024 for 10 products, eventual revised deadline of 1 October 2024 for 5 products (final list: <a href=\"https://www.tec.gov.in/pdf/MTCTE/MTCTE%20Extension-%20Oct%2024.pdf\">https://www.tec.gov.in/pdf/MTCTE/MTCTE%20Extension-%20Oct%2024.pdf</a>).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Presently, such products can be tested and certified in laboratories globally, or at in-house laboratories of the manufacturers (self-certification). Mandatory testing and certification by Indian laboratories has been expected to trigger additional cost and unnecessary delays for companies. To facilitate, Indian government allowed the acceptance of test results/reports from labs accredited by ILAC signatories, until 30 November 2021 (for Phase-I and Phase-II products), 30 June 2023 (for Phase-III and IV products) &ndash; later revised (first to 31 December 2023, then to 31 March 2024, then to 31 July 2024 and eventually to 30 September for select products), 31 August 2024 for phase V products (with an extended deadline of 30 September 2024 for select products where deadline for mandatory certification has been extended). However, it is to be noted that on the date of submission of test reports, the test reports issued by ILAC signatories in such cases should not be older than two years. Link: <a href=\"https://tec.gov.in/pdf/MTCTE/Document%202.pdf\">https://www.tec.gov.in/pdf/MTCTE/MTCTE%20Extension-%20Oct%2024.pdf</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While India has established 4 Regional Telecom Engineering Centres (RTECs) for testing and certification, the capacity of testing laboratories in India remains unclear. Meanwhile, the validity of the MTCTE test reports issued by TEC designated labs for all parameters has been extended to ten years. Starting in 2024, India has also started accepting valid certificates or test reports issued by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) or BIS-recognized labs against safety requirements; accepting test reports from Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) designated for Generic Requirements (GR) and Interface Requirements (IR) for the parameters of Essential Requirements (ER) under MTCTE; and accepting Source Approval Certificates. Additionally, the TEC has also brought 37 more products under the Simplified Certification Scheme (SCS) with effect from 1 January 2024, in efforts to reduce time taken for certification from eight weeks to two weeks, and to enhance ease of doing business. These products include media gateway, IP security equipment, IP terminals, optical fibre or cable, transmission terminal equipment, and others. With this, the total products under SCS have now gone up to 49 from 12.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The EU concerns refer to deviations from international standards, forcing companies to mandatory in-country testing, which could also lead to duplication of test efforts for the European companies, ad-hoc delays caused and additional cost burden incurred due to such tests. Indian government argues it is attempting to augment domestic testing capability to support domestic companies to take these tests within India, thereby helping them to save high costs incurred in taking these tests outside India. It is understood that EU telecom businesses such as Nokia and Ericsson have been manufacturing key equipment in India itself and therefore, they haven&rsquo;t expressed much worries on the scheme. However, sufficient testing capacity in India still remains a concern for the companies.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, India also intends to introduce security testing and certification for telecom equipment. The guidelines were expected to come into force from 1 July 2023, however the deadline was revised to 1 January 2024, and later extended to 1 July 2024 for models that have not undergone mandatory testing and certification of telecom equipment (MTCTE) certification, and 1 October 2024 for models that have already got MTCTE certificates. Telecom equipment manufacturers have urged the government to make the security testing voluntary and requested a two-year extension on the deadline citing limited testing capacity (only three accredited labs) and high costs of testing. It is expected to be integrated with the safety testing requirements and could further results in delays, additional cost burden for the European companies. Moreover, there are concerns related to Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), as the government intends to test the softwares vulnerabilities for backdoor access to data by third-party laboratories.</p>",

        "description": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In September 2012, India issued TBT notification IND/44 on a draft law imposing the registration of 15 electronics products. After several postponements, the scheme entered into force on 3 January 2014. It was extended to further 15 products by order of 8 November 2014 (in force in the meantime for all these products). At the same time, an obligation was introduced to self-declare registration information (through screen-printing/embossing/engraving on the product or the packaging material). With regard to that some exemptions were temporarily introduced in the course of 2014 (such as the allowance of non-removable stickers or marking on the packaging for small products) but the gist of the burdensome scheme remains in place.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">India has in August 2017 further extended the coverage of the registration scheme to an additional 13 products (in total 44 products). In April 2020, India further extended the coverage to an additional 12 products (in total 56 products). Later in October 2020, India again extended the coverage to an additional 7 products (in total 63 products now). In March 2021 India issued &ldquo;Electronics and Information Technology Goods (Requirement of Compulsory Registration) Order, 2021&rdquo; covering all 63 products with requirements kicking in from 18 September 2021 (link: <a href=\"https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/CRO2021-and-ammenment.pdf\">https://www.meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/CRO2021-and-ammenment.pdf</a>). In July 2021, a deferred deadline of 6 months was granted to manufacturers that were already registered and met the criteria established for such exemption. In April 2023, television sets were added to the list bringing the total to 64 products. In April 2024, detailed security requirements were introduced for CCTV cameras. A transition period of three months (max) was provided, from the date of coming into effect of the Order for the particular product category, for affixing Standard Mark at the ports which are already having registration number from the BIS for clearance of goods from customs.</p>",

        "country": "India",
        "description": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since 2014, in its drive to promote domestic manufacturing, India progressively increased customs and other duties on ITA products, encompassing diverse tax rates between 7.55% and 20%. India's increased duty rates affect imports of products such as mobile phones, mobile phone components and accessories such as static converters, base stations, or certain printers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In April 2019, the EU requested consultations with India to address concerns around duties on selected ICT goods. In February 2020, the EU moved to request the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) to establish a dispute resolution panel (later joined by Japan and Chinese Taipei). After adjudication of the dispute by this panel in April 2023, it observed that India&rsquo;s measures were inconsistent with its WTO obligations and were to be brought into conformity. India and the EU negotiated to arrive at a mutually agreeable solution following the ruling however, India appealed in WTO&rsquo;s appellate body (currently not functional) against the decision of the panel in December 2023 after the EU filed for adoption of the panel report.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As of 1 February 2022, India accorded unconditional duty-free treatment to some of the identified ICT products &ndash; this was also recorded by the dispute adjudicating panel established by the WTO DSB as India being consistent with its WTO obligations with respect to such products. In February 2024, India reduced the import duty from 15% to 10% on some parts used in making mobile phones (such as battery covers, main camera lenses, back covers, other mechanical items of plastic and metal, GSM antenna, die-cut parts and other parts). Further, import duty on inputs used to manufacture these components was cut to zero. As of July 2024 (as part of the Union Budget 2024-2025), the basic customs duty (BCD) on mobile phones, printed circuit board assemblies (PCBAs), and chargers has also been lowered from 20% to 15%. The duties have been slashed to zero for oxygen-free copper used in resistor manufacturing and specific components for connector production. However, duties on PCBA for telecom equipment were increased from 10% to 15%.</p>",

        "title": "Government procurement - Local content requirement",
        "country": "India",
        "description": "<p><u>Electronics and telecom equipment manufacturing &ndash; preferential market access policies</u>: on 10 February and 5 October 2012 respectively, the Government of India published a new preferences policy to domestically manufactured electronic goods in procurement due to the security considerations and in Government procurement. After the suspension of this policy by the Prime Minister's Office on 8 July 2013, a new preference policy was adopted for electronic products in <em>Government procurement </em>on 23 December 2013, which eliminates security as a reason for preferences. Furthermore, this new PMA policy is limited to government procurement only, and not extended to private purchases. Local content and value addition requirements for government procurement, however, remain the same. A series of implementation notifications followed. A new preference policy for telecoms is still outstanding (together with implementing guidelines). On 29 August 2018, India issued a new notification, increasing the scope of the measure: The original PMA from 2012 reserved 100% preferences for 19 out of 23 telecom products listed. &nbsp;In the new policy a total of 36 telecom products is listed; for 12 products PMA&nbsp;is at 100%. This policy will be applicable on projects funded by the central government.</p>\n<p><u>Renewable energy &ndash; solar power plants</u>: the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) laid down local content requirements for solar power plants. The Solar Mission is to be implemented in three phases; the third phase will end in 2022. The first round of selection of projects took place in 2010-2011 based on certain local content requirements (e.g. use of cells and/or modules manufactured in India for solar PV projects). Phase 2 was launched in October 2013 mandating a domestic content requirement: out of the total capacity of 750 MW, 50% (so 375 MW) was kept for bidding with Domestic Content Requirement (DCR). Under DCR, 100% of the solar cells, modules and thin films used in the solar PV power plants must both be made in India. The US challenged this programme at WTO: in August 2015, the panel found that DCR measures were not justified. A notice of appeal has been filed by the Indian government. The DCR is also proving an obstacle to the development of local solar power production because India's manufacturing capacity is low, more expensive than foreign imports and of a lesser quality.</p>\n<p>After India's appeal, the case dragged on with India claiming to have stopped applying the measures in question, and the US considering that this was not the case and asking the WTO to implement retaliatory measures. Eventually, this dispute was settled as part of the package of mutual agreement annouced by India and the US on 17 July 2023. However, it is unclear what this mutual understanding entailed. The JNNSM was foreseen to end in 2022, but it should be noticed that the Indian Ministry of&nbsp;New &amp; Renewable Energy (MNRE) has annouced on 10 March 2023 that solar power commissioned before 31 March 2024 would be exempted from DCR. This might be part of the package deal with the US, but it is likely mostly motivated by the difficulties of solar power project developpers to source their modules from domestic producers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><u>Iron and steel products:</u>&nbsp;As part of PM Modi's \"Make in India\" Strategy, on 3 May 2017 the Cabinet approved a policy for the use of domestic steel products in government organisations.&nbsp; The policy makes it mandatory to give preference to Domestically Manufactured Iron and Steel Products (DMI&amp;SP) in government procurement.</p>\n<p><u>Medical devices:</u> DPIIT issued the Public Procurement order dated 16.09.2020, as per Order No. P-45021/2/2017-PP (BE-II ), whereby only local suppliers having a local content of more than 20% will be able to bid for any Central or any State Government tenders that utilises central funds, for tender value below 200 Crore INR. Subsequently, Department of Pharmaceuticals (DoP) issued an order F.No.31026/36/2016-MD, reiterating the adoption of the Order. Further, DoP issued two orders dated 16th February (Annex 1) and 25th March (Annex 2): F. No. 31026/36/2016-MD<strong>, </strong>and F. No. 31026/36/2016 &ndash; MD, respectively, restricting procurement of 130 diagnostics products and 19 categories of Medical Devices from class I local supplier only, with local content 50 % and above. This blanket declaration&nbsp;for&nbsp;19&nbsp;categories of medical devices where&nbsp;only class I local suppliers&nbsp;shall be eligible to bid in public procurement tenders adversely impacts EU companies. The revised PPO released on March 25, 2021 further indicates a list of manufacturers that may or may not have the manufacturing capacity to produce and supply these 19 medical devices categories that the Department of Pharmaceuticals deem India has sufficient manufacturing capacity for. However, the list fails to include global manufacturers that have invested significantly in India&rsquo;s domestic manufacturing of quality medical devices that cater to both the local and global supply chains. The overlooking of local manufacturing units of such global innovators risks giving a negative signal to EU companies considering investments in India</p>\n<p><strong>2024</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The government is planning to tweak its procurement policy. DPIIT - The industry department has floated a proposal to raise the minimum local content requirement for public procurement for Class-I and -II suppliers from 50 per cent currently to 70 per cent, and 20 per cent as of now to 50 per cent, respectively. A proposal rearding the same was shared by the government with the industry, including EU companies. The Head of Delegation in New Delh shared a Letter with the Senior Officials at the Indian Industries Department and the Department of Telecommunications in May 2024. In the letter the HOD highlighted the ill effects that such a hike in local content requiremenst may cause on the EU comapanies in India.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Trade Section of the Delegation also prepared a Note for the EU HQ Govt. Procurement team, negoatiating the EU-India FTA with India. The Note covered on various topics, such as the functioning and ownership of Central public sector enetrprises that are authorized for government procurement in India, espacially the CPSE's or any other Indian authorities related to Urban Railways, Electricity transmission, Airports, Water ports and Mines. This note was prepared for the 8th FTA round that was held in Brussels in June 2024.&nbsp;</p>",

The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) did not carry out audits of foreign manufacturing plants as international travel was suspended due to Covid-19. This resulted in disruption of supply chains and delay in audits of foreign plants by BIS officials.</p>\n<p><strong>Wheel rims: </strong>Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises (Department of Heavy Industry), circulated a Draft Automobile Wheel Rim Component (Quality Control) Order 2020 on 25 May 2020 as per Notification G/TBT/N/IND/147.

Currently in India, quality and performance of the wheel rims are safeguarded mandatory with requirements of IS 9436-1980 / IS 9438-1980. Tests are conducted by notified type approval authorities assigned under Central Motor Vehicle Rules (CMVR) Rule 126 (namely ARAI / ICAT, etc.).

The QCO further states that provided further that nothing in this Order shall apply to goods or articles imported as a part of any finished good or sub-assembly or component. The QCO covers 19 products.</p>\n<p><strong>HELMETS</strong>: Through a draft Notification dated 30 July 2020, India added Protective Helmet for Two Wheeler Riders under mandatory certification. The effective date for the draft QCO to come into force was 1 March 2021<strong>. </strong>However, on the issue of protective helmets, there has been no input from the EU industry, whether in the EU or in India. It is also not clear whether India has notified this QCO to the WTO. <strong>The QCO on Helments entered into force on 1 June 2021.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>BRAKE LININGS: </strong>Through a draft Notification of October 2020, the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprise has issued a draft QCO mandating India-specific BIS markings for the &ldquo;Replacement Brake Lining Assemblies and Drum Brake Linings for Power Driven Vehicles and Their Trailers&rdquo;. Accordingly, the replacement brake lining needs to comply with Indian Standard 17132. The intension is to regulate the after-market brake lining suppliers. The brake linings used for vehicle manufacturing and supply as spares are exempted provided the brake lining type shall be same and vehicle model shall be homologated in India. The brake lining supply as spares for CBU vehicles which are imported in India under the homologation exemption rule are not exempted. This QCO is still in the draft stage.</p>\n<p>Meetings and exchanges have taken place with the officials from DPIIT and the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) to reconsider their decision to remove QCOs on auto parts and to accept virtual audits or third party certification in absence of physical audits. However, India has been deferring the implementation of QCOs on auto parts because it was unable to carry out physical audits as India had imposed restrictions on international travel.</p>",

Indonesia does not accept foreign companies to certify compliance with particular ISO standard, even if these companies are accredited by international agencies that are members of ILAC and other international bodies. Instead, Indonesia imposes specific testing carried out by companies recognized by Indonesia, duplicating procedures and creating a burdensome and costly process.

Alternative ways are not accepted.</p>\n<p>The <strong><em>Ministry of Industry Regulation 45/2022</em></strong> on Industrial Standardisation, issued on 4 November 2022, updates the requirements for obtaining and keeping National Indonesian Standard (SNI) certificates. The Regulation explains the procedures to which stakeholders have to abide from requesting a SNI certificate, the review process of requests for SNI till the (annual) assessments to determine whether certificates are eligible for extension. The Regulation covers the Technical Standard certificate (TC) detailing the technical specifications that need to be fulfilled while the Guidelines for Procedures (PTC) explains the procedures that have to be followed while producing the product and how production equipment needs to be maintained. The TC and the PTC are the basis for the issuance of the SNI. <br /><br />The Regulation requires firms to have a presence in Indonesia in order to be eligible to apply for a SNI. The system will be e-managed with the Ministry of Industry being firmly in control of the process. The whole process seems to be very cumbersome with Conformity Assessment Agencies being appointed ad hoc. An international firm may have to deal with several agencies simultaneously. It seems very unlikely that European certification institutes can be appointed as Conformity Assessment Agency in the absence of a mutual agreement of technical specification between the EU and Indonesia. Outcomes of the approval process of SNI requests are not always predictable. International firms may apply and submit all appropriate documents. However, the Ministry of Industry has the right to turn down applications on the basis of threats to the domestic industry, especially small and medium enterprises. Another challenge is embedded in the implementation. Regular inspections should take place at least 2 times in a period of 5 years. These inspections may include factory visits and market surveys.</p>\n<p>b.<strong> <em>Industry Law (Law 3/2014) </em></strong><strong>and<em> Standardization Law (Law 20/2014)</em></strong><em>,</em> complemented by the <em>Government</em> <em>Regulation 201/2000</em> on the National Standardisation, and the Head of National Standardisation Agency (BSN) <em>Regulation 135/2010</em> on the National Standardisation System, are potentially trade restrictive, in terms of the strict use of national standards and preference given to local products.</p>\n<p>c. The <strong><em>Halal Law 33/2014</em></strong> sets out a broad and restrictive regime on halal products. The EU has been closely monitoring the situation to avoid bringing trade to a halt. As of September 2019, implementing rules are still unclear. The <em>Government</em> <em>Regulation (Peraturan Pemerintah) PP No. 31/2019</em> on the Implementation of the Law No. 33 of 2014 on Halal Product Assurance, has been applied since 3 May 2019. The first stage of compulsory halal certification covers food and beverage products, starting from 17 October 2019 and ending on 17 October 2024. After 17 October 2024, all food and beverage products should already have obtained the halal certification. On 14 October Indonesia notified the TBT Committee a second draft implementing regulation, which further details the transition periods established for the implementation of mandatory certification for all category of products, other than food and beverages. Transition may last up to 2034 (goods for medical devices of risk C). The next stage for the halal certification is for traditional medicines, health supplement, cosmetics, chemical products, clothing, headgear and accessories, household appliances etc. and will last from 17 October 2021 to 17 October 2026.</p>\n<p>d. <strong>The Law No. 11 of 2020 on Job Creation (Omnibus Law)</strong>, which was passed by the Indonesian House of Representatives (DPR) on 5 October 2020 and took affect since 2 November 2020, reformulates a number of elements of the Halal Law. Re-instating halal-certification obligation for all products circulating in Indonesia, the Law stipulates that companies (domestic and international) failing to register their products prior to entering Indonesia are subject to administrative sanctions. However, it does not provide detailed guidance on international recognition and co-operation. The Law expands the reach of halal certification obligation to Indonesian micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).</p>",

The revision is part of the structural reforms mandated by the Omnibus Law on Job Creation (Law No 11/2020). Overall, it is a positive development.</p>\n<p>The Omnibus Law removed:</p>\n<p>- The category of &lsquo;sectors open with conditions.&rsquo;<br />- The Government&rsquo;s obligation to reserve sectors for MSMEs and cooperatives.<br />- Sectoral discrimination towards foreign investments from 5 sectoral law.</p>\n<p>Presidential Regulation No 10/2021 further reduces the number of business activities subject to at least one investment restriction from 813 to 260.</p>\n<p>The EU has interest in a number of sectors which previously restricted to foreign companies (\"foreign equity caps\") including in pharmaceuticals and their raw materials, telecommunications, IT, banking and insurances, horticulture, beverages, transport and logistics services, oil/gas, retail, etc. Restrictions on the majority of these sectors have been relaxed or removed in the last Investment List.</p>\n<p>b) Some specific sectors are not covered by the DNI list, but are regulated by specific separate laws, for instance the <em>Construction Law</em> and the <em>Horticulture Law</em>.</p>\n<p>c) minimum investment requirement for foreign investment of IDR 10 billion or approximately EUR 0.6 million (set by regulation 5/2013 from the Indonesia's Investment Coordinating Board - BKPM) and this excludes land and building assets.

The Presidential Regulation No 10/2021 also provides exemption for technology-based start-ups located in Special Economic Zone.</p>\n<p>d) Minister of Manpower <em>Decree No 228/2019</em> issued on 27 August 2019 lists employment positions open to foreigners. The Decree increases the positions available for foreigners by more than three times (from 656 to 2.196 positions).

A minimum of 5-year experience and the employer&rsquo;s obligation to provide training in Indonesian language are additional conditions.</p>\n<p>In the latest positive development, in February and March 2021 the government issued Government Regulation 34/2021 and Manpower Minister Decree 8/2021 and revoked Manpower Minister Decree 10/2018. The new regulations simplify requirements to hire foreign workers and facilitate access to critical skills from abroad. The reform is part of the mandate of the Omnibus Law.

This concerns especially the exports of basic commodities, such as oil, gas and minerals.</p>\n<p>c) <strong>Mining sector restrictions</strong> - <em>Regulations 7/2012, 11/2012 and 20/2013</em> banned exports of unprocessed mineral and metal ores, except coal, with the objective to increase local value-added of minerals through processing and refining. <em>Regulation 1/2017</em> allowed exports of unprocessed and semi- processed mineral ores until 2022. However, the relaxation requires the exporting company to build smelters within five years and convert their Contract of Work scheme into Special Mining Business License (with less investment protection and uncertain tax regime). Foreign miners must also gradually divest their shares up to 51% to a local entity after 10 years of production in order to extend their export permits. In parallel, a progressive export tax scheme from 20-25% in 2014 to 60% in 2016 on 65 mineral categories was introduced.</p>\n<p>On 30 August 2019, in a move to secure supply for domestic smelters and support a national programme on electric vehicle, the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources issued <em>Regulation 11/2019</em> to <strong>bring forward the implementation of the export ban on nickel ores</strong> to 1 January 2020, two years ahead of the initial plan. Indonesia is a key global supplier of important metals such as nickel, copper and bauxite. While EU nickel imports from Indonesia are limited, the restrictions are having indirect economic effects on globally traded raw materials as well as on the EU industry.</p>\n<p>b) Mining sector restrictions - On January 2014 Indonesia implemented export restriction to all raw mineral ores (11 metals, 8 non-metal minerals, and 19 stones) in an effort to develop the downstream industry of the sector, as mandated by the Law No 4 of 2009 on Mineral and Coal Mining. The full ban was planned to be implemented in 12 January 2017. As implementing regulations, Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources issued Regulations 7/2012, 11/2012 and 20/2013 on guidelines to increase local value-added of minerals through processing and refining. Furthermore a progressive export tax scheme from 20-25% in 2014 to 60% in 2016 on 65 mineral categories was introduced.</p>\n<p>However, on 11 January 2017, the Indonesian government issued Government Regulation No 1/2017 which allowed companies to continue exporting unprocessed and semi-processed mineral ores, previously subject to full ban starting from 12 January 2017 mentioned above. Subsequently, as implementing regulations, the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources issued Regulation No 5/2017, No 6/2017, No 7/2017, No 9/2017, and No 15/2017 to stipulate the technicalities.</p>\n<p>The current regime stipulates that holders of Contract of Works (CoW), Operation Production Mining Licenses (OPIUPs) and Special Mining Business Licenses (IUPKs), producing concentrate forms of copper, nickel ore, and certain other metals, will be allowed to continue to export their concentrate and ore products, in quantities approved by the Ministry of Energy &amp; Mineral Resources, for a maximum of five years from 11 January 2017 as long as they:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the case of CoW holders, convert the CoW status to<em> Izin Usaha Pertambangan Khusus</em> (Special Mining Business Licence &ndash; IUPKs), with less investment protection</li>\n<li>in the case of foreign-owned OPIUPs and IUPK holders, commit to divesting 51% of their issued shares to local parties within ten years of commencing production;</li>\n<li>commit to constructing domestic smelters within five years;</li>\n<li>have their smelter construction plans independently verified and approved by MEMR;</li>\n<li>make 90% ongoing progress in fulfilling their commitment to domestic smelter construction;</li>\n<li>renew their export permits every twelve months;</li>\n<li>for nickel ores producers, collectively supply 30% of the low nickel content ore required by domestic smelters; and</li>\n<li>pay the applicable export tax of up to 10% (stipulated by Minister of Finance Regulation No 13/2017)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Indonesia is a key global supplier of important metals such as nickel, copper and bauxite. While the EU imports from Indonesia were limited, indirect economic effects on the EU are likely to result from the impact of the restrictions on globally traded raw materials. In addition the EU is concerned by the systemic effect of a ban on export, one of the most extreme and damaging restrictions, setting a very damaging precedent in a time of resource nationalism.</p>\n<p>In June 2020, Indonesia passed the new Coal and Mining Law. Export restrictions on raw minerals remain.</p>\n<p>On 21 December 2022, President Widodo announced Indonesia will ban export of bauxite ores and washed bauxites starting from June 2023.</p>\n<p>The export ban on bauxite ores has been enforced since 10 June 2023. According to Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Regulation No 7/2023, export of other mineral ores (copper, iron, lead, zinc, anode slime) are still allowed until 31 May 2024, provided that producers meet certain progress in smelter construction. Mineral producers are still negotiating the possibility of exporting the ores after May 2024.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Effective on 1 May 2020, the Minister of Trade Regulation No. 40/2020 on Terms of Use of National Sea Transportation and National Insurance for Export and Import of Certain Commodities requires coal and crude palm oil (CPO) exporters, as well as importers of rice and government procurement goods, to utilise domestic shipping lines and insurance companies. It revokes the Regulations No. 80/2018 and No. 82/2017. The Regulation No. 40/2020 stipulates the national flag obligation on ships with capacity of up to 15,000-deadweight tonnage (DWT). Nevertheless, the regulation obliges the use of national insurance for the stated commodities.</li>\n<li>In an attempt to boost the development of the local pharmaceutical industry Indonesia introduced 25% Local Content Requirements for raw materials for pharmaceuticals (<em>Presidential Instruction 6/2016</em> 5 and 6), ignoring the fact that over 95% of active pharmaceutical ingredients in Indonesia are still imported and that the domestic environment is not conducive to attract R&amp;D investment. (See also barrier 12780 on domestic manufacturing requirements for patented products).</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>b) Government procurement</strong>: Indonesian legislation mandates the <strong>use of domestic products in government procurement</strong> in key sectors. Furthermore, <em>Presidential Regulation n. 54/2010</em> as amended by Presidential Reg. No 18/2018 and Presidential Reg. No. 12/2021, foresees significant additional restrictions to foreign companies, i.e. forced partnership with local companies, increased local content requirements, and substantially higher threshold for foreign companies to participate in tenders (for construction services the new threshold is IDR 1 trillion from previously IDR 100 billion, for consultancy services IDR 25 billion from IDR 10 billion, and for goods and services IDR 50 billion from IDR 20 billion).</p>\n<p>The regulations states that in the implementation of mandatory for local product purchasing, the planning, preparation, and vendor qualifications procurement should be taken into account.</p>\n<p>The regulation requires procuring entities to seek maximum local content, use foreign components only when necessary, and designate foreign contractors as sub-contractors to local companies. Articles 66 and 67 (preferences for domestic products) make locally produced goods and services mandatory for use in procurements from all relevant ministries, institutions and regional governments. Local goods or services are defined to be those where at least 40 percent of the total value is comprised of local components or inputs. Foreign goods and services are permitted only when not available locally, and/or domestic production volume is not capable of meeting necessary demand.</p>\n<p><strong>c) The Government Regulation No. 29 of 2018 on the Empowerment of Industry</strong> underlines the increase usage of domestic products (Articles 54 to 56) and the obligation to use domestic products (Articles 57 to 64) as prerequisites to develop the national industry. The requirement remains, although some provisions of the regulation have been amended through the Government Regulation No. 28 of 2021 on the Organisation of Industrial Sector.</p>\n<p>In September 2021, Indonesia frozed 79 medical device product groups, covering 5,462 imported products, in the e-Catalogue of government procurement, preventing their purchase by government health institutions. The decision to delist the medical device products was made solely after the meeting on local content chaired by the Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment in September 2021 that, if there are domestic medical devices that reach 40% Domestic Content Level, then National Public Procurement Agency (LKPP) is obliged to delist the imported products.</p>\n<p><strong>d. Using economic recovery as a pretext, Indonesia saw the COVID-19 pandemic as an ideal time to strengthen overall national industrial structure</strong>, to increase production effectiveness and output, and to overcome dependence on imports.</p>\n<p>As of November 2024, through the Minister of Communication and Informatics (MCI) Regulation No 13/2021 (replacing Reg. 27/2015), Indonesia obliges <strong>LTE telecommunication devices produced or imported into Indonesia to meet a minimum local content of 35% for subscriber station</strong> (e.g. mobile phones, tablet devices) and <strong>40% for base station</strong> (e.g. Base Transceiver Station/BTS and its associated equipment).</p>\n<p>Minister of Industry (MoI) holds the authority to determine the methods to fulfil these LCRs. According to MoI Regulation 29/2017, industries can meet the LCRs for mobile devices through three methods:<br /><br />Manufacturing: includes domestic manufacturing and assembly process, use of local materials and labour, etc. This&nbsp; method has the highest weight, up to 70% in the total LCR calculation.</p>\n<p>R&amp;D: includes local content in software development, industrial and layout design. This method can account up to 20% of the total LCRs calculation<br /><br />Innovation Development:&nbsp; This third method allows companies to meet LCRs through investment in 'innovation'. The investment tiers range from IDR 250 billion (EUR 14.7 million) to over IDR 1 trillion (EUR 59 million), with higher investments granting higher LCR percentages, from 20% to 40%. The required investment amount is set through a feasibility analysis (assessing the benefit to the industry) and negotiation with the Ministry, which then formalised in the LCR certification.</p>",

The new added provision on post-border mechanism (goods can go directly to warehouses while inspection will be done based on risk management by technical ministry in post border) and remove a requirement to get recommendation from the Ministry of Industry to get import approval. However, other restrictions remained.</p>\n<p>The Minister of Trade Regulation No. 117/2018, issued in December 2018, further amended the provisions on tyre. The regulation reinstates that imports can only be carried out through Bonded Logistic Centres, where inspection takes place. The regulation also re-introduces the requirement for import recommendation issued by the Ministry of Industry as a pre-requisite for import approval issued by the Ministry of Trade.</p>\n<p>The Ministry of Industry issued Regulation No. 31/2019 that amends Regulation No. 1/2017 on the guidelines for issuance of tyre import recommendation. Effective since October 2019, the new regulation divides import for further production, i.e. \"producer\", into two category based on the industry: automotive industry and non-automotive industry. Application of tire import recommendation is conducted online through SIINas. Requirements for producers include tyre import plan, plan for production that will utilise the imported tyre, and import realisation. Meanwhile, requirements for general importer includes tyre import plan and realisation.</p>\n<p>Some of the difficult processes and requirements that Indonesia has been imposing since 2021, i.e. cumbersome import quota request mechanism and uncertainties in extension of Indonesian National Standards (SNI) extension, remained in 2022.

However, as the regulation did not contain any significant updates relating to the discriminatory excise policy, this intervention continues to be marked as in force. 2)&nbsp; Amendment Ministry of Finance Regulation No. 207/PMK.011/2013 of the initial regulation 62/PMK.011/2010: The new law concerned involves an excise tax but it discriminates against imported alcoholic beverages. Compared to previous regulation where the excise tax for beverages with 5-20% of ethyl alcohol was 30'000 IDR/litre for locally produced bottles and 40'000 IDR/litre for imported ones, the excise tax was raised for both cases by 10%. Also, the excise tax for the category with over 20% of ethyl alcohol has been changed. Locally produced bottles will be taxed 80'000 IDR/litre (previously 75'000 IDR/litre), while imported ones 139'000 IDR/litre (before 130'000 IDR/litre). The applied tax rates discriminate against imported spirits for drinks &gt;5% alcohol.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3). In July 2015, the import tariff scheme for cider, class B alcoholic drinks, and class C alcoholic drinks was changed from a specific tariff to an ad valorem tariff following the issuance of Ministry of Finance Regulation No. 132/PMK.010/2015. The import tariff is set at 90% of the market price for cider and class B alcoholic drinks and at 150% for class C alcoholic drinks. This resulted in a steep increase in the unit price of imported wine and spirits, and widened the price gap between local and imported products. At the same time, the increase in import tariff creates higher incentives for illegal trade of alcoholic drinks in Indonesia.</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"0\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"0\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"40\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"133\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"133\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"27\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"13\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"147\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"13\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"0\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"40\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"133\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"133\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"27\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"13\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"147\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"13\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"0\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"40\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"133\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"133\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td colspan=\"4\" width=\"200\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"0\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"7\" width=\"507\">\n<p>4) The Minister of Finance issued Regulation No. 158/2018 increases the excise tax paid by both local producers and importers, valid as of 13 December 2018.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"174\">\n<p><strong>Categories</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"132\">\n<p><strong>Pre 13 DEC 2018</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"132\">\n<p><strong>From 13 DEC 2018</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"174\">\n<p><strong>Excise Tax</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"265\">\n<p><strong>IDR per L</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"174\">\n<p><strong>For Category A, B, and C</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"132\">\n<p>20,000</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"132\">\n<p>20,000</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"174\">\n<p><strong>Category A</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"132\">\n<p><strong>13,000</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"132\">\n<p><strong>15,000</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"174\">\n<p><strong>Category B (Domestic)</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"132\">\n<p>33,000</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"132\">\n<p>33,000</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"174\">\n<p><strong>Category B (Imported)</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"132\">\n<p>44,000</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"132\">\n<p>44,000</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"174\">\n<p><strong>Category C (Domestic)</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"132\">\n<p>80,000</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"132\">\n<p>80,000</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"174\">\n<p><strong>Category C (Imported)</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"132\">\n<p>139,000</p>\n</td>\n<td width=\"132\">\n<p>139,000</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Indonesia&rsquo;s alcohol excise regime applies specific rates per volumetric litre in bands based on the alcohol content (alcohol-by-volume, or abv) of the product.

One of these is the distribution of goods.</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"ms-rodlStyle-PrimaryTextIntroduction\">The <strong>Government Regulation No. 28/2021 on Operation of Industry Sector</strong>, also an implementing regulation of the <strong>Law No. 11/2020 on Job Creation</strong>, mainly establishes a new mechanism of licensing and a new legal framework for future incentives related to the procurement of raw and supporting materials.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Non-automatic import licensing, pre-shipment controls and customs procedures</strong> (including sampling and testing procedures) hamper trade. In some cases, this situation adds up to tariff peaks or changing customs duties - which, although in compliance with WTO law, further hamper market access. Several regulations, namely the Ministry of Trade <em>Regulation</em> <em>27/2012 (amended by Regulations 59/2012, 84/2012 and 70/2015) and regulation 83/2012 (replaced by Regulations 61/2013, 87/2015, 94/2015 and 81/2017</em>) covering pre-shipment controls and entry port restrictions for more than 800 products, create a complex, non-transparent and burdensome non-automatic import licensing system. This system can result in <em>de facto</em> quantitative restrictions, for instance on alcoholic beverages, which are also subject to fiscal discrimination. <em>Decree 53/2018</em> of the Ministry of Agriculture sets out the obligation for fresh horticultural products to obtain a registration number from January 2020.</li>\n<li><strong><em>Law No. 13/2010</em> on Horticulture and the <em>Law No. 18/2012</em> on Food</strong>, foresee the possibility to restrict imports of all kinds of food products, including seeds. It results in complex import processes, requiring several permits from different institutions and compliance with various standards.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>SPECIFIC</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>Regulation 77/2016 </em>reintroduced import <strong>restrictions on tyres</strong>, which had been successfully removed in 2015. It restricts imports in order &ldquo;<em>to support the availability and supply of domestic tyres, to support national tyres industries development, to create fair competition, and to increase national competitiveness.</em>&rdquo; The Regulation includes provisions obliging distributors/importers to import through bonded logistic centres. It mandates an additional layer of import procedures and limits the availability of bonded warehouses, generating significant additional costs.</li>\n<li>Indonesia's <strong>iron and steel import restrictions</strong> affect the automotive sector&rsquo;s ability to have access to replacement parts. Cumbersome procedures apply to obtain exemptions. Ministry of Trade <em>Regulation No. 110 of 2018 on Import Provision of Iron and Steel, Alloy Steel and Its Derivatives</em> also imposes import through bonded logistic centres. The regulation no longer provides exemption from the requirement for import approval of iron less than 1 metric ton.</li>\n<li>On <strong>alcoholic beverages</strong>, in addition to very high import tariffs with imported spirits being subject to a 150% and wines to a 90% import customs duty, &nbsp;Indonesia applies high and discriminatory excise duties. Since January 2019, <em>de jure</em> quantitative restrictions have been removed and a new annual forecast and distribution plan has replaced them. Though improved, the system may still limit importations, de facto, by disadvantaging those importers who ask for a large import volume, since they have to pay in advance the full amount of the import duty corresponding to the volume on the import license but may be penalised if eventual sales are lower.</li>\n<li>On <strong>agricultural</strong> products, the <em>Government Decree No. 35/2016 on Types and Tariffs of Non-Tax State Revenues</em> sets out tariff categories for services provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and generates <strong>high costs for inspection/audit services</strong> on establishments exporting animals, animal products and veterinary drugs to Indonesia. Audits are to be carried out in the companies' countries of origin. Though some Member States establishments have applied for recognition inspection even prior to the issuance of the decree in August 2016, they are now subject to new fees (see also under Food and Agricultural products, including SPS issues).</li>\n<li>On <strong>chemical </strong>products, on April 13, 2018, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry released a list containing 3.887 chemicals: 134 categorized as banned, 2.071 categorize as restricted and 1.682 chemicals categorized as free to use.

As of today there are 9 countries have concluded CRA with ID: Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa and United States.

While obtaining a CRA would require systematically an audit, it is possible that recognition of the laboratory system does not seem toneed a mandatory audit. This still needs to be clarified with Indonesia. The Regulation 55/2016 introduced a third option, not explored yet, for exports without laboratory registration, but with more stringent consignment tests and import checks.

Indonesian legislation requires both country and establishment approval (through both a declaration (questionnaire), import risk evaluation and on-site assessment) for import of meat and meat products.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">This process is burdensome and non-transparent. The criteria for passing the approval process are unclear, thus resulting in a long approval procedure. Related to others diseases, Indonesia require absence of a number of diseases in a country or establishment for which OIE does not consider trade measures necessary.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Trading conditions (not SPS) set in Regulation 42/2019 make even more complicated market access: restrictions on certain cuts and products, , an unclear and complex import license system, including the two-layer requirement to import, i.e. import recommendation from the Agriculture Minister and import permit from the Trade Minister. Also Halal matters are a significant complication.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"> New policies are planned without consulting trading partners, potentially completely banning or severely obstructing imports.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Since the introduction of the ban in 2001 the EU together with trading partners have consistently raised the issue in all available fora, and in bilateral meetings.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"> Update: the regulation 58/2015 apparently might allow imports of countries with controlled risk status, though the wording make this unclear. The EU is still trying to get clarification on this. As mentioned, a number of non-strictly SPS barriers are still present in this regulation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Update: the regulation 42/2019 continues the same pattern, with apparently allowed imports from countries with controlled risk status but unclear procedures and requirements. The COM made comments in writing but no feedback has been received.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The EU will continue requesting clarification on the procedures and requirements.</span></p>",

        "description": "<p>In 2009, Malaysia removed the requirement for a Foreign Investment Committee (FIC) to screen proposed investments and repealed FIC Guidelines on the acquisition of interests, mergers, and takeovers, thereby reducing the minimum equity requirement for <em>bumiputera</em> in locally incorporated companies from 30 % to 12.5% for newly listed companies. With the abolishment of the Foreign Investment Committee, Malaysia removed its all-round foreign equity ceiling of 70%. Despite the fact that the general cap is removed, foreign equity restrictions remain in certain sectors. These are imposed by the different Ministries, rather than by a central body. Apart from formalized regulation on the matter, Ministries may also impose equity restrictions as a condition to obtain a license.</p>\n<p>A separate set of regulations is imposed to reserve equity in businesses for ethnic Malays or <em>Bumiputera</em>. The rationale is to increase business participation of the <em>Bumiputera</em>. While ethnic Malays are the majority racial group in Malaysia, they are underrepresented in the country&rsquo;s business community, which is largely made up of ethnic Chinese and Indians.</p>\n<p>In these cases, the restrictions on foreign equity are not in favour of nationals of Malaysia, but ethnic Malay. In other words, a foreign invested company where the non-foreign equity is held by individuals who aren&rsquo;t ethnically Malay would still fall foul of the law. The issue continues to be politically sensitive.</p>\n<p>Areas which are subject <em>Bumiputera </em>reservations include banking and finance, water, <em>batik</em> production, agriculture, defense, energy and telecommunications.</p>\n<p>Generally, investment in manufacturing is fully liberalised but investment in services remains subject to foreign equity caps in many sectors.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Government retains the authority to review and approve all investments by both domestic and foreign investors through the issuing of licences by the relevant Ministries, which generally enjoy full discretion in regard to licensing decisions. The licensing requirement applies to investment in manufacturing over RM 2.5 million, or having more than 75 employees. Licenses are required to carry out nearly all services activities. Foreign equity caps remain, notably for investment in telecommunications (70% for network services/facilities providers), oil and gas services (49%), insurance (70%), and transport. Foreign investment in newly privatised entities is limited to 25%. Malaysia makes extensive use of investment incentives and performance requirements are imposed on investors.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "description": "<p>The registration in Mexico of foreign geographical indications (GI) as such used to be impossible and alternatives offered only weak and uncertain protection. This led to a number of imitations and usurpations of European names and GI&rsquo;s, which affect the access to the market of the authentic products and raise confusion among consumers. The new FTA contains provisions for the reciprocal protection of a selected list of Geographical Indications of the EU; 340 names for foodstuffs, wines and beers will be protected. This is on top of the already existing protection for EU spirits GIs protected through the 1997 EU/Mexico Spirit Agreement, which will also be incorporated into the new agreement, raising its level of protection.<br /> <br /> &nbsp;<br /> <br /> <strong>Background</strong><br /> <br /> The EU has a wide variety of protected GIs. They represent an important pillar of the EU&rsquo;s quality policy on agricultural products and constitute a genuine interest for producers as they unlock value by capitalising on consumer&rsquo;s desire for diversity and quality products.<br /> <br /> The registration of foreign GIs in Mexico used to be difficult despite Mexico&rsquo;s obligations under the TRIPS Agreement, as the national GI legislation was unclear as regards GI protection and inappropriate for foreign GIs. <br /> <br /> The registration of a foreign GI as such used to be technically impossible in Mexico, since the legislation stated that the Federal State is the owner of any Denomination of Origin (DO). The only ways for a European GI to obtain some protection within the Mexican territory were to register its name as a collective trademark at the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (IMPI), or when covered by the Lisbon Agreement (of which Mexico is a party) or by the EU-Mexico bilateral Spirits Agreement signed in 1997.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some EU right holders have tried without success for a long time to protect their rights via the trademark system, which handles applications in a sometimes non consistent way &nbsp;Registration of a GI as a collective trademark does not provide sufficient protection since the compliance to the Mexican quality standard is voluntary (while it is compulsory for Mexican DO), and also because any disputes would have to be solved in court, which involves lengthy, costly and uncertain procedures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In April 2017, the Senate approved a major revamp to the IPR Law, which included some significant changes for national and foreign GIs. The amendments include very important changes with respect to Appellations of Origin (AOs), and for the first time in Mexico specific protection for Geographical Indications (GIs) is included.&nbsp; Regarding foreign GIs, IMPI will recognise those protected in a foreign country upon the terms of the International Treaties. The owner of a DO or GI protected in a foreign country will be entitled to apply for its recognition by filing an application before IMPI and enclosing the document showing the protection under the laws of the corresponding country or according to the international treaties.&nbsp; The grounds of refusal, opposition rules and invalidation are set identically as those for national applications. Cancellation, however, will proceed when the document showing foreign protection is not valid any longer in such country.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition, the new FTA contains provision for the reciprocal protection of a selected list of Geographical Indications of the EU; 340 names for foodstuffs, wines and beers will be protected. This is on top of the already existing protection for 217 EU spirits GIs protected through the 1997 EU/Mexico Spirit Agreement, which will also be incorporated into the new agreement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Before the new FTA comes into force however, EU food products continue to suffer from another widespread practice; the misuse of expressions such as \"tipo &hellip;\" or \"estilo &hellip;\" on labels. These branding practices generate unfair competition, consumer confusion and contribute to undermining the reputation and image of the genuine products. The latest IPR reform also addressed this issue, with the imposition of administrative offences, as it prohibits the production, storage, transport, distribution or sale of a product equal or similar to those protected&nbsp; under a DO or GI national Declaratory or those foreign DOs or GIs recognised by IMPI, using any type of indication or element misleading consumers as to the quality or origin of the products, including those as \"kind\", \"type\", \"manner\", \"imitation\" or the like.</p>",

A simplification of procedures and reduction of administrative costs would not only facilitate trade, but also release public resources that could be allocated more efficiently elsewhere, such as for security concerns or intellectual property (IP) enforcement.</p>\n<p>The Government partially addressed these issues with a customs reform in 2008, as it sought to abolish the estimated price system, cancel the importers&rsquo; register, eliminate the need to present a formal certificate of origin for sensitive products and eliminate certain monopolistic measures such as the single channel for imports. Further encouraging steps to facilitate trade were taken in the recent customs reform of 2013, which was published as law in the official gazette on 9 December 2013 and came into effect on 10 December 2013 (Decreto por el que se reforman, adicionan y derogan diversas disposiciones de la Ley Aduanera).</p>\n<p>The reform of 2013 aimed to reinforce trade facilitation by creating a customs electronic system, meaning that all import and export customs declarations are now to be filed electronically. Another important and long standing issue, which this reform addressed, was the abolishment of the obligatory use of custom brokers. Importers and exporters are able to carry-out their own customs clearance.

The EU was engaging with Morocco on this issue to gain sufficient understanding on the new requirements, that would ensure compliance for EU MS establishments, via the notification channel and bilaterally.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Following several exchanges on this matter, the final issue remained&nbsp;whether when certifying compliance, Morocco would accept that the EU Member State competent authorities do so based on the EU requirements, as those are equivalent to level of safety required by Morocco. The Commission considered that this would facilitate the process of registration on the EU side by providing a clearer legal situation, in which certification is based on EU requirements and not directly the Moroccan ones.</p>\n<p>The European Commission proposed a language according to which the EU Member State competent authorities would certify that the food establishments <em>&lsquo;are subject to official controls under the European Food Law&rsquo;.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On this proposal, Morocco stated in writing that they considered that there was no major divergence between the Moroccan and EU food legislation. Furthermore, Morocco recognised the competence of the competent EU Member State authorities and their level of effective safety controls on food in the EU.</p>\n<p>In our views, this has created more legal certainty when registering EU establishments on this final main issue.

In addition, Morocco uses <strong>domestic compulsory standards</strong> that are de facto technical regulations.</p>\n<p>According to Law 24-09, all economic operators (producers, importers) are expected to respect the general obligations of safety and place on the market products that comply with safety requirements according to the applicable technical regulation. However, even if the standards and technical regulations are the same, there is a difference in the way controls/conformity assessments are carried out on local and imported products.</p>\n<p>The <strong>externalised conformity assessments for imports</strong> have been introduced on 1 February 2020<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a> in the framework of a reform of the system of market surveillance. Some of the targeted products also need to be accompanied by the Moroccan marking Cmim (separate market access entry in Access2Markets<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\">[2]</a>). The system was originally presented as a way to facilitate imports into Morocco of products meeting EU standards but this is not proving to be the case.</p>\n<p>For the majority of products subject to the system, exporters need to obtain the conformity assessments in the country of origin (<a href=\"https://www.mcinet.gov.ma/sites/default/files/Produits%20controlables%20%C3%A0%20l%27origine%20M%C3%A0J%2004-03-2022.pdf\"><em>produits control&eacute;s &agrave; l&rsquo;origine</em></a>), while for the others they will need to obtain them upon arrival in Morocco (<a href=\"https://www.mcinet.gov.ma/sites/default/files/Produits%20controlables%20au%20Maroc%20M%C3%A0J%2004-03-2022.pdf\"><em>produits control&eacute;s &agrave; l&rsquo;arriv&eacute;e au Maroc</em></a>).</p>\n<p>The system has proven costly, time consuming and redundant, duplicating assessments already carried out in the EU, especially if the standards used are the same. Furthermore, sometimes exporters got contradictory information from the conformity assessment bodies mandated to undertake assessments; some were requested to submit sensitive commercial information.</p>\n<p>According to the website of the Moroccan Ministry of Industry and Trade, conformity assessments carried out in the country of export are only acceptable if carried out by the authorised Moroccan conformity assessment bodies or if Morocco and the country have concluded a Mutual Recognition Agreement.</p>\n<p>Controls/conformity assessments on <a href=\"https://www.mcinet.gov.ma/fr/content/surveillance-du-march%C3%A9\">local products</a> aimed at ensuring market surveillance and risk management are carried out by the regional and provincial delegations of the Ministry of Industry and Trade. Officials from the Ministry collect samples from producers and distributors, which are analysed by one of the Moroccan conformity assessment bodies recognised/mandated to carry out checks depending on the type of product. These checks are not systematic.</p>\n<p>At the same time, it appears that <strong>Moroccan standards</strong> are developed based on international and/or EU standards, but that minor variations are introduced, implying that EU exporters have to undertake again third party conformity assessment based on Moroccan standards, with associated delays and costs, even when the same third party certification has been done in the EU for virtually the same standard. Morocco does not justify in each and individual case why the international standard has not been used/derogated from as a basis for the technical regulation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.mcinet.gov.ma/fr/content/surveillance-du-march%C3%A9\">http://www.mcinet.gov.ma/fr/content/surveillance-du-march%C3%A9</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\">[2]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://trade.ec.europa.eu/access-to-markets/en/barriers/details?barrier_id=14862\">https://trade.ec.europa.eu/access-to-markets/en/barriers/details?barrier_id=14862</a>&nbsp;</p>",

Ahead of its adoption, the EU had repeatedly shared its concerns, both bilaterally and on the occasion of the WTO Trade Policy Review of Morocco, which led to some improvements of the text. The law foresees, without prejudice to Morocco's international obligations, the possibility to grant protection to domestic producers via tariffs and quantitative restrictions, whenever this is required by the general interest. More specifically, protection may be granted to infant industries (\"productions nouvelles\") and&nbsp;producers of agricultural goods.</p>\n<p>No concrete problematic cases were brought up by EU stakeholders (MS, industry) in Morocco in recent years in the framework of the application of the law.&nbsp;In December 2019, the Commission considered that no further action was needed on this issue and decided to close the file.</p>\n<p>However, the Commission remained vigilant notably in view of the&nbsp;possible&nbsp;adoption of the decrees implementing the law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The case was therefore reopened in March 2022 as it was brought to the Commission's attention that a draft decree, implementing the law, has been prepared by the Moroccan Ministry of trade and was submitted to the Secretariat General of the government for adoption.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Draft Decree 2.22.30 contains several problematic features:</p>\n<p>- it foresees the mandatory registration of all exporters and importers to a new Registry administered by the Ministry of trade, whereas the conditions and criteria for registration will only be known subsequently (via arret&eacute;). The purpose of such a Registry is not specified but it appears to be motivated by the desire to better identify active traders and fight informality.</p>\n<p>- for some sectors to be determined, the draft decree foresees the establishment of \"specifications\" (Cahiers de charges), drawn by competent authorities in consultation with local sectoral associations, whereby importers and exporters of products covered by such specifications will need to declare their compliance with the conditions provided therein. The rationale for such system is unclear. It seems it will be additional to the existing system of third party conformity assessment, which is already considered burdensome by exporters to Morocco.</p>\n<p>- it also establishes a consultative Commission on imports, located within the Ministry of trade, whose responsibility is to examine all requests for protection (via tariffs or quantitative restrictions). This will be additional to the existing structures responsible for examining and implementing trade defense measures, which Morocco is an active user.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The continuous increase of registration fees is excessive and appears to be much higher for imported products compared to locally manufactured products. Since the NAFDAC procedures changed in 2002, NAFDAC representatives physically inspect all production facilities of any new products sold in Nigeria. This increases the costs. Companies have to register every product type and a separate registration fee has to be paid for different sizes of the same product type.</p>\n<p>Foreign companies also complain that in practice it is too difficult to register their goods themselves at NAFDAC although the procedure allows for it. A Nigerian partner (such as a distributor) is required who registers the product in his name.

International public competitive bidding in Paraguay is used as an exception to national bidding only in specific circumstances and, in the event of equivalent offers, preference is given to the offers which incorporate certain levels of local content. In addition when assessing the economic value of different bids, contracting entities may grant a certain margin of preference of up to 10%. In 2010 Paraguay introduced with decree 4008/2010 price preferences for goods and services of Paraguayan origin for a period of one year. Decree 6225/2011 and law 4558/2011 replaced decree 4008/2010 and continue with similar margins of preference for local content.

Moreover, companies from countries with no reciprocal treatment for Paraguayan firms can be excluded from bidding.</p>\n<p>International public competitive bidding in Paraguay is used as an exception to national bidding only in specific circumstances and, in the event of equivalent offers, preference is given to the offers which incorporate more that 50% of local content. In addition when assessing the economic value of different bids, contracting entities may grant a margin of preference of up to 10% (Article 18 of Ley 2051/2003).</p>\n<p>On 26 February 2010 Paraguay introduced with decree 4008/2010 national price preferences in public tenders for a period of one year, which was replaced by decree 6225/2011 and law 4558/2011 (see below). Paraguay has introduced these temporary preferences in order to increase national production and local employment to overcome the international economic crisis. The margin of preferences shall be determined by the contracting entities and range between 5% and 70% for manufactured goods and between 20% to 70% for primary products of agricultural origin. For construction services, the contracting entity can require the contractors to have at least 70% of the personnel locally recruited.</p>\n<p>On 4 March 2011 Paraguay published <strong>decree 6225/2011 </strong>which replaced decree 4008/2010 <strong>regarding public works and infrastructure</strong>. The margin of preferences may range between 5% and 70%, for manufactured products 40%, for primary products of agricultural origin between 20% and 70%, for construction services at least 70% of the personnel must be locally recruited, and for services 10%.</p>\n<p>On 15 December 2011 Paraguay published<strong> Law (Ley) 4558/2011 regarding good and services</strong>, which foresees in national tenders a margin of preferences of 20% for local products and services. National products are defined as being from Paraguayan origin or with an imported part of up to 40%, while national construction services require at least 70% of the locally recruited personnel.

        "description": "<p>The Representation law 194/93 regulates relations between foreign companies that export to Paraguay and local representatives / distributors in Paraguay. Under this law compensation has to be paid to the representative, when foreign exporters, without a justifiable reason, cancel, revoke, modify or do not renew their contract with a local representative / distributor in Paraguay. The amount of compensation is set through the judiciary or through arbitration. The law provides only broad criteria, leaving much to the discretion of the courts, which creates a situation of legal uncertainty for European exporters. There is a current legal draft in discussion to reinforce even more the protection of local representatives / distributors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>The Representation law (Law No. 194 of 6 July 1993, which replaced the Decreto-Ley 7 of 27 March 1991), establishes the legal framework governing relationships between foreign companies that export to Paraguay and their Paraguayan representatives. The law requires that exporters to Paraguay prove just cause when they terminate, modify or fail to renew contracts with Paraguayan distributors or agents. If such a relationship is ended without proving just cause, the foreign company must pay its representative an indemnity, which is not fixed in the law. This is giving rise to broad discretional criteria of the court to fix this amount, which creates a situation of legal uncertainty for foreign firms. It seems that in some cases foreign companies paid large sums when ending distribution relationships in Paraguay to avoid lengthy court cases or have maintained ineffective representatives to avoid such payments.</p>\n<p>Under Law 194/93, the amount of compensation is set through the judiciary or arbitration based on (1) the length of the agreement and (2) the gross earnings of the representative / distributor. All foreign exporters / importers can cancel, revoke, modify or not renew their contract with the local representative/distributor without paying compensation provided there is a justified reason for it, notably one of the following:<br />a. breach of the contract;<br />b. fraud or abuse of trust in the duties entrusted;<br />c. ineptitude or negligence;<br />d. any act imputable to the representative/distributor, which results in damage to the sales, distribution etc.;<br />e. conflict of interest.</p>\n<p>Before claiming any of the above the exporter shall ask the representative / distributor to solve the problem within 120 days. Following this period, the exporter can claim its rights immediately except in cases of fraud or abuse of trust. The importer should make its claim before the judiciary or through arbitration, otherwise unjustified reasons will be assumed. In the event of cancellation, irrespective of the compensation awarded, the representative / distributor has the right to sell the existing stock to the exporter at market price (i.e. including profit).</p>\n<p>The agreement between importer and representative/distributor can be demonstrated by one or more of the following:<br />- Authorising letter to manage the local market.<br />- Bills that demonstrate trading deals between the parties.<br />- Payment for a commission to the representative / distributor for trading deals during at least the last two years before the entry into force of this law.<br />- Advertising and publicity expenses claiming the representative/distributor role, the importer being aware of it and not opposing it.<br />- Claims by representative / distributor of commissions for operations not done through him, which have been paid by the importer.</p>\n<p>This legal uncertainty has the effect of deterring EU companies from exporting to Paraguay. These restrictions could deny the Paraguayan economy inputs that are necessary for its development. In addition, by offering disproportionate protection to local operators, beyond their legitimate needs, the law protects and rewards inefficiency, which does not serve the interests of the Paraguayan economy.<br />The termination indemnities and other requirements apply only to foreign suppliers. Local suppliers are not obliged under this law or under similar conditions regarding the relationships with distributors or agents.</p>",

Yet what is more pernicious is the ban on what the WOAH deems &ldquo;safe commodities&rdquo; which in this case corresponds to pork derived products.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These measures contravene the terrestrial code of the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH). Articles 15.1.2 and 15.1.23. The terrestrial code firmly states regarding safe commodities that &lsquo;regardless of the health status of the country or zone of export concerning African swine fever, veterinary authorities should not require any conditions related to this disease when authorizing the import or transit through their territory of the following safe commodities.&rsquo; These articles explicitly mention two of the commodities considered safe (&lsquo;gelatin and any meat packaged in a hermetically sealed container with an Fo value of 3 or higher&rsquo;), as well as the procedures for inactivating the African swine fever virus in meats, thereby making them safe for export.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In the case of Italy, SENASA, the official health authority, has refused to exclude &ldquo;safe commodities&rdquo; from the ban and refused to conduct a risk analysis on Italy&rsquo;s pork product chain. Moreover, it pressured Italy to request a Community Risk Analysis (ARC) to the Andean Community (CAN) despite the fact CAN norms require the importing country (Peru) to make the request.</p>\n<p>COM requested PERU in the 2021, 2022 and 2023 SPS EU-Andean subcommittees to correct the document in their website; to take into account the pest free areas established at the EU level; and remove countries which have not had ASF outbreaks in the past years (BE, CZ).</p>\n<p>In parallel, the CAN started the ARC on Italian pork products. In at least two stages, the CAN could have excluded &ldquo;safe commodities&rdquo; from the analysis. It did not. As of today, the CAN has requested an in-situ audit.</p>\n<p>COM and EUDEL met with Peru in the May 2024 implementation mission and reiterated that point.</p>\n<p>COM sent Peru on 20 June 2024 a letter requesting to open the market for safe commodities and excluding them from the risk analysis.&nbsp; Otherwise, if market not open inmediatly, COM may escalate this issue to the next levels.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Imports under the TRQs have started in late 2012, but many issues still remain, namely problems of tariff classification, wood sorting requirements as well as administrative issues. The quotas have been severely underused (at a level of only 10-15%) since their opening - this has not changed over time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In <strong>September 2020</strong>, President Putin ordered the Government to prepare a complete ban on exports of certain unprocessed coniferous round-wood starting from 1 January 2022.

The new law in Article 14 stipulates that national treatment will be extended to foreign goods and services if and only if a specific international agreement Russia is a party to explicitly says so. Furthermore, a list detailing such specific international agreements will be established and published by the competent Russian agency for public procurement. These rules are a deterioration of the situation of EU businesses in Russia compared to the status quo ante. Russia has committed itself to join the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) and notify this intention to the WTO Government Procurement Committee at the time of accession.

Russia also introduced a 15% price preference for Russian companies when participating in State-owned enterprises call for tenders. This is a separate issue from public procurement restrictions as this issue concerns commercial actors/operations. Russia adopted on 31 December 2017 Law 496 allowing the government to tighten control over procurement of expensive ships and planes.</p>\n<p>Some key measures are outlined below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Restrictions for importing/foreign companies to supply SOEs or private companies running investment projects above RUB 10 bln (EUR 140 mln) &ndash; private companies provided that the State subsidises at least 10% of the project. This is in place since 2016. Among the restrictions listed: need to notify the project to a registry, need to receive the approval of an \"import substitution commission\", list of goods that cannot be bought abroad etc.</li>\n<li>15% price preference: Russia adopted Decree 925 on 16 September 2016 allocating a price preference of 15% to domestic/Russian companies in the framework of SOEs' purchases. That means that importing companies (for goods) or foreign companies (for services) compete with domestic/Russian companies which are granted an advantage of 15% when comparing the prices of the respective bids. However when the domestic/Russian company is selected, it is paid the normal price as announced in the bids.</li>\n<li>Law 496 of 31.12.2017 allows the government to introduce local content requirements on aircraft and ships purchased by SOEs</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Law 44/2013 FZ on Government Procurement was amended by Law 174-FZ of 29 June 2018.

However, internet piracy (including but not limited to social networks) remains a great concern, and there is only piecemeal progress at best with regard to the goal of approximating Russian copyright legislation in this area to EU and US models.</p>\n<p>Sale and use of counterfeit goods using trademarks for clothes, luxury products, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals products are also widespread and take place both in street markets and in mainstream retail. Furthermore, systematic infringements of patents, commercial secrets and know-how in innovative sectors such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals, mechanical engineering and the IT industry continue to injure EU businesses.</p>\n<p>There is also misappropriation of intellectual property rights through obtaining patents for alleged inventions or through registering trademarks that are identical or strikingly similar to the trademarks of foreign companies.</p>\n<p>The establishment of the Customs Union between Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus on 1 January 2010 (the Eurasian Economic Union since 2015) has on balance created additional risks for IPR protection. The borders of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan continue to be under-patrolled, allowing for entry of counterfeit goods and for illegitimate parallel imports from Asian countries, notably China.</p>\n<p>Russia's accession to the WTO and the creation of the new Russian IPR Court in early 2013 could over time prove positive developments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On the positive side, the signature of the EU-Kazakhstan EPCA and the EU-Armenia CEPA gives the EU a leverage to influence the EAEU, notably in view on the provisions on national / regional exhaustion that these agreements contain.

In accordance with the Order, the international road transport heading to the territory of the Russian Federation should be led via Ukraine or Baltic states. This would increase the transport costs for hauliers from Slovakia and other EU countries by approximately EUR 400 per route. At the same time, the waiting times at the remaining international border check-points of the Russian Federation would disproportionately increase. Moreover, many of these border check-points do not have facilities necessary for diverting all transport operations. Since the restriction does not apply to Belarusian and Russian hauliers, the foreign (incl.

Importers have to fill in the information on the imported products, manufacturing facility and shipment through a proforma invoice. The modalities of registrations is not clear as the user guide requires a Commerce Registration number which limits the access to local traders and the possibility that exporters can have access to the system if importers register them as &ldquo;contact officer&rdquo; is not acceptable. It is not clear if importers must include the information by model or format, which would multiply the costs for the exporters as they pay per uploaded item and importer, instead of registering product groups only. In addition, the breakdown of products down to 10 digit level of ceramic tiles is applied as opposed to the 6 digit level HS codes currently utilised internationally on ceramic tiles. All these factors increase unnecessary the costs of registration.</p>\n<p>The exporter has to get more additional information as required by the standardisation authority SASO requires due to technical regulations and product certification schemes which have to be provided through the new program SALEEM.

During the factory auditing, the inspectors must select a product sample from each type (group of absorption) and test it in an external certified laboratory (ISO 17067). &nbsp;The items being audited are very similar to those evaluated by the ISO 9001 and the same as those evaluated by the ISO 14001.

Furthermore, section 217 of the Constitution provides for the statutory framework of the procurement system, being the Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act of 2000.</p>\n<p><strong>Some key changes in the 2022 Regulations vs the 2017 Regulations:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Where the 2017 Regulations allowed for the application by organs of state of pre-qualification criteria &ldquo;to advance certain designated groups&rdquo; (black people, women, persons with disabilities, and small enterprises), the 2022 Regulations no longer provide for this.</li>\n<li>Although the same 2017 preference point scoring system is still in place, the 2022 Regulations permit the procuring institution to decide on &ldquo;the specific goal specified for the tender&rdquo;, previously only B-BBEE contributor status level was provided for.</li>\n<li>Importantly, the 2022 Regulations now also cover tenders for income-generating contracts, and those in the acquisition of goods and services. Thus, government contracts for commercial gain, are also covered by public procurement rules.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;An important exclusion from the 2022 Regulations is that of local content requirements. The revised draft legislation (the Public Procurement Bill), is however expected to include LCR rules.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br /> <strong>The Preferential Procurement Regulations of 2022</strong> as was the case with the 2017 version, provides for a preference point scoring system, though now does allow organs of state more discretion when allocating these points. &nbsp;Bids for public tenders are still scored on an 90/10 split on price and economic development for contracts above R50 million and 80/20 split for contracts up to R50 million The current legislation is currently under revision, and a new Bill has been published for consultations to which the EU participated and submitted comments. In the current draft, the Ministry of Finance has been left with the discretion to elaborate ad hoc localisation rules that would then fall outside the scrutiny of the Parliament.</p>\n<p><strong>The Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers Programme (REIPPP)</strong>, which has seen strong participation from the European companies, was established in 2010, and was granted an exemption from government&rsquo;s standard procurement processes. The, exemption allowed IPP Projects to be evaluated based on a 70/30-point system, instead of the PPPFA&rsquo;s 90/10 or 80/20 preference point system. The minimum threshold for local content reached 45% in the latest round with the target being 60%.</p>\n<p>REI4P projects are evaluated using a 70/30 weighting, where 70% is based on price, and 30% is accounted for by various Economic Development Criteria. The non-price criteria were introduced to encourage the development of remote areas, and bidders are required to identify opportunities to invest in skills development, local suppliers, and entrepreneurs, as well as providing ownership opportunities to local communities. Within the Economic Development criteria, local content accounts for 25% of the weighting, which is equivalent to 8% of the overall project score</p>\n<p><strong>Local content requirements also feature strongly in the Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) legislation.</strong> The Department of Trade, Industry and Competition (DTIC) published amendments to the Codes of Good Practice on 31 May 2019 with a six-month transitional period to be effective from 1 December 2019.The codes have to be complied with for any economic activity with a public institution or entity. The Codes emphasize i) Ownership; ii) Skills Development; iii) Enterprise, and Supplier Development as priority elements which require a 40% sub-minimum compliance.</p>\n<p><strong>Private procurement in the key economic sectors might also become subject to local content requirements.</strong> In particular the new <strong>mining charter</strong> (27 September 2018 in force since March 2019) stipulates that a minimum of 70% (by value) of mining goods must be manufactured or assembled in South Africa &ndash; this requires that at least 60% local content be used during manufacture or assembly and 80% of services required by holders of mining rights must be procured from local manufactures who must also comply with the B-BBEE regulations. In addition, all local content used in the manufacture of goods must be certified by the South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) &ndash; the cost of which may be covered either by the mining right holder, or by the supplier.</p>\n<p>The 70% of <strong>total spend on mining goods</strong> procurement must be apportioned as follows</p>\n<ul>\n<li>21% to be spent on South African manufactured goods produced by Historically Disadvantaged Persons (HDP) owned and controlled companies;</li>\n<li>5% to be spent on South African manufactured goods produced by women or youth owned and controlled companies; and</li>\n<li>44% to be spent on South African manufactured goods produced by BEE compliant companies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A minimum of 80% of the <strong>total spend on services</strong> (including non-discretionary expenditure) must be sourced from South African companies and allocated as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>50% must be spent on services supplied by HDP owned and controlled companies;</li>\n<li>15% must be spent on services supplied by women owned and controlled companies;</li>\n<li>5% must be spent on services supplied by youth owned and controlled companies; and</li>\n<li>10% must be spent on services supplied by BEE compliant companies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are <u>two fundamental problems with the Mining Charter&rsquo;</u>s approach of setting a blanket 60% local content target:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It does not recognise the different opportunities, challenges and constraints faced by different sub-sectors of the industry in terms of achieving local content targets.</li>\n<li>It does not promote exports, which are critical to both the growth and sustainability of the industry.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Mining Charter further introduces Local Content verification requirements to ensure the mining goods meet the thresholds in the Charter. The South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) should verify the local content percentage, the costs of which must be borne by the mining right holder or the suppliers. Certification certificates from SABS will not be required for the first 2 years of the transitional period (until March 2021).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On 4 October 2021, the Acting Chief Procurement Officer at National Treasury issued a circular stipulating a minimum threshold of 100% is to be implemented on local production and content<strong> in the cement sector, </strong>effective 4 November 2021.</p>\n<p><strong>All EU MS affected.</strong></p>",

The announcement has to be made for each canton separately, an unnecessary burden for businesses active in several place (e.g.: maintenance agreements).</p>\n<p><u><strong>Deposit requirement for foreign service providers</strong></u></p>\n<p>Article 2(3) of the Swiss law on the minimal working conditions of posted workers authorises the discriminatory extension to foreign service providers of a deposit obligation prior to the supply of the service by means of a collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p><u><strong>Universal Application of Collective Agreements (\"Normalarbeitsvertr&auml;</strong></u><u><strong>ge)</strong></u></p>\n<p>The EU-Swiss Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons provides for the possibility to set out rules for minimum wages for the protection for the posted workers. The Swiss law on posted workers grants the possibility to declare collective agreements universally applicable which covers the whole range of employments, wages, emoluments and other charges thus discriminating EU service providers. Furthermore, for determining the applicable reference wages inspectors apply frequently the highest wage category.</p>\n<p><u><strong>Obligation to contribute to control fees and charges</strong></u></p>\n<p>Article 7, paragraph 4a of the Swiss law on the minimal working conditions of posted workers which was introduced by law of 17 December 2004 and became applicable as of 1 April 2006 provides for the possibility to charge general control costs also to businesses providing services. Within collective agreements the Swiss government authorises trade unions and employers to levy discriminatory control charges at EU service suppliers calculated as yearly fees for businesses and monthly fees for workers. Furthermore, many collective agreements provide for a kick-back to Swiss businesses as the contribution to the Swiss employers organisation and the Swiss worker&rsquo;s contribution to trade unions can be deducted from those liabilities.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Disproportionality of sanctions</strong></span></p>\n<p>Swiss cantonal authorities have repeatedly imposed disproportionate sanctions, e.g. minor errors on wage declaration amounting to CHF 10 resulted in sanction of CHF 500.</p>\n<p>The maximum applicable administrative sanction has been increased from CHF 5000 to 30000.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Blacklists</strong></span></p>\n<p>Sanctions include a ban on business activities for up to 5 years in case of serious or repeated breach.

However, the excise tax discrimination in favour of local white distilled spirits remains unchanged.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;- <strong>Certain deviations of mandatory alcohol standards from international standards</strong>: as Thailand requires alcohol quality analysis (certificate of analysis) as part of the alcohol import licensing procedures, based on domestic standards that are not fully aligned with international standards.</p>\n<p>Thai authorities have confirmed the acceptance of Certificates of analysis issued by foreign laboratories as an alternative to testing at the laboratories of the Excise Department that are free of charge and therefore preferred by importers. Thai authorities also allow for some flexibilities through the application of a margin of tolerance on the non-typical substances and the acceptance for the self-certification for the substances that are not permitted at the EU.&nbsp;These arrangements have avoided major disruption to trade flows.</p>\n<p>- <strong>Stringent and non-transparent rules on labelling requirements, leaving discretion to the authorities to challenge regular labelling practices</strong>: the notification of the Excise Department on alcohol labelling in force since 2015 prohibits in a broad and unclear manner the use of messages that misleads consumer, promotes or induces alcohol consumption. Despite different guidelines issued by Thai authorities, there are still open questions about the use of expressions to characteristics and quality of the products (e.g. \"finest\" or \"premium\").</p>\n<p>The Ministry of Public Health has also come in two occasions with proposals to impose tobacco-like graphic health warning labelling requirements on alcoholic beverages. The last proposal in February 2024 was finally discontinued following strong opposition from stakeholders. A new draft notification on alcohol labelling presented in mid-2024 would introduce messages to warn underage and drunk drinking which are very much aligned with the business practice.</p>",

The FBA covers horizontally all types of services and reserves certain activities in mode 3 exclusively to Thai nationals.</p>\n<p>The FBA classifies services activities in three categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>List 1 strictly closes to foreigners the following activities: farming, forestry, trading of antiques, trading of land and broadcasting.</li>\n<li>List 2 imposes foreign ownership limits for business activities that involve national security, arts and culture, natural resources and the environment.</li>\n<li>List 3 limits the foreign ownership in businesses to below 50% for a comprehensive list of services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For activities in lists 2 and 3, a higher foreign equity is possible (maximum 75% for list 2 and 100% for list 3) subject to specific authorization (Foreign Business License). This authorization is only granted on a case-by-case basis by the government, Cabinet for list 2 and the Foreign Business Committee for list 3, after consultation with the relevant Thai business associations.</p>\n<p>The current legal definition of a foreign juristic person in the FBA refers to equity ownership only. By strict interpretation, the FBA does not limit control or use of preferential voting shares to control a company by foreigners. In the past, Thailand has attempted to further tighten the rules for foreign participation beyond the capital limitation by adding foreign ownership criteria based on the control of companies (voting rights and/or management control). The Ministry of Commerce have also increased investigations regarding nominee recently.&nbsp;These rules have left the services market in Thailand largely closed to foreign majority owned companies with highly complex sharholding structure and it gives an advantage to influential domestic conglomerates.</p>\n<p>Since 2016, the Ministry of Commerce has periodically issued exemptions to the list of restricted activities under List 3 of the FBA. The exemptions must be read with caution as businesses exempted are generally regulated under other specific rules and regulations. The relevant licenses still have to be obtained from responsible authorities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>NEW: In 2024, the Ministry of Commerce finalised a list of 11 services activities which has been floated around since 2019 for exemption under the FBA. The exemptions include, inter alia, domestic trade of traditional agricultural products which is traded in the Futures Exchange Centre; Telecommunication License Type 1 (no network); Treasury Center Business; some services offered to affiliated companies; and software development business. The list is pending approval from Minister of Commerce. Then, it will be proposed to the Cabinet. Once approved and announced in the government gazette, the exemption will become effective. No timeline is indicated by the Ministry of Commerce.</p>\n<p>In addition to the restrictions to ownership under the FBA, a number of service sectors are also regulated by sector specific laws e.g. insurance, banking, telecommunications, transport, etc. Similarly as in the FBA, regulators in certain sectors like insurance and banking, while maintaining a general rule on Thai majority ownership, allow a foreign majority on a case-by-case basis subject to a Cabinet decision. Other regulators, notably the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission and Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand have introduced controversial foreign dominance criteria (e.g. management control, using preferential shares with different voting rights to control, etc.) into the operating licensing conditions in addition to the equity ownership.</p>",

This is the case since spring 2020 for <strong>chocolate, chocolate products and cheese</strong> (see NTB fiche 15769).

In the last years, it has got more complicated to obtain the approval of the authorities regarding the technical requirements. The procedures to obtain the approval are blocked constantly. The authorities have seven days to check the goods but they do not fulfil the time limitation. Samples have to be tested twice a year. All in all, ceramic tiles are retained by the Tunisian custom authorities in the port at least for 2 months before the cargo is allowed to enter the market. This causes an increase in the cost of the final price. No complaints since 2021. </p>\n<p><strong>Tyres: </strong></p>\n<p>Tyres are subject to technical specifications and systematic testing. However, in the absence of a dedicated technical control center with the capacity to implement all necessary tests, the tests are partly outsourced and carried out for the Ministry of Industry within the premices of the STIP private company, which is the local tyres producer.&nbsp; In addition, the STIP has experienced in 2023 temporary periods of technical lay-offs, during which the premises were closed and no tests could be carried out, hence empedding the techncial control procedures.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As per Article 10 of the Tunisian &ldquo;Cahier de Charge&rdquo;/ technical specifications, Tunisian regulation requires tyres to comply with either European (ETRTO) or American (DOT/FMVSS) norms/regulations.&nbsp; However, when it comes to the tests, they are performed according to different norms,&nbsp; Tunisian norms. This is a contradiction. Finally the Tunisian norm is equivalent to ISO 10191 and ISO 10454, which are however obsolete.</p>\n<p>More importantly, as a contracting party of UN58 having implemented UN Reg 117, Tunisia should accept E-marked tyres without further testing; any local test should be aligned to UNECE regulations R30 or R54<strong><em>.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Finally, Tunisia imposes the stictest time limit in the world, imposing that tyres must be no more than 6 months old by the time of release into free circulation.Ths appears to be disproportionate and not based on scientific evidence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The scope of this mechanism is broad and gradually expanding via regular new communiques. The Turkish authorities justify the measure by the need to prevent cheap exports from third countries (mainly Asian).</p>\n<p>Prior to the import operation, if the imported products' price is below a threshold unit value, the importer has to apply for a surveillance license to the Ministry of Trade. The application file contains information about the importer, the declarant (if different from the importer), the exporter, the producer and information about the imported product. Documents such as the original or notary-certified copy of the list of the authorized signatures of declarant, copies of the pro-forma invoice or the commercial invoice.</p>\n<p>In practice, after applying for a surveillance licence, exporters are requested to submit a number of additional documents containing confidential business information (total turnover, capacity, total production, total domestic sales, total exports, etc). &nbsp;In such situation, given the extreme difficulty to secure the surveillance license, importers are de facto forced to declare the unit price determined in the communiqu&eacute; instead of the real transaction value. This increases their declared customs value and the&nbsp;tax base upon which VAT is calculated. This leads to competition distortion between exporters and local producers.</p>\n<p>A concurrent problem is that companies are not easily able to get refund of overpaid VAT amounts. Before July 2021, companies could sue for overpaid VAT amounts and were able to obtain court decisions in favour of refunds. However,&nbsp; with an amendment of Article 211, paragraph 1 of the Customs Law (through an omnibus law published in the Official Gazette of 28 July 2021), Turkiye decided that &ldquo;customs value of the goods subject to a trade policy measure increased by way of operator&rsquo;s self-declaration&rdquo;, whereby no remission or no repayment of customs duties is provided. Furthermore, a Presidential Decision published on the Official Gazette of 24 November 2023&nbsp;abolished the right of sellers to deduct overpaid VAT&nbsp;as a result of&nbsp;application of surveillance and trade defence measures.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Turkiye argues that if EU operators have specific problems to obtain \"surveillance document\" the Ministry may look into them. However, beyond the solution of individual cases, the systemic problem remains, creating obstacles to imports and leading to overpayments of VAT, which are never recovered.</p>",

        "country": "Turkey",
        "description": "<p>T&uuml;rkiye&nbsp;has been applying a banderol (strip stamp) to alcoholic beverages since November 2007. The banderol system was introduced to cope with tax evasion and counterfeiting of alcoholic beverages. A banderol is defined&nbsp;as a sale document applied to the inner packaging of alcohol and alcoholic beverages to be placed on the market. It indicates the supervision, inspection and compliance approval of the competent Authority (i.e. the Department of Tobacco and Alcohol - &lsquo;TADAB&rsquo;-, which operates under the Ministry of Agriculture).Before 15 June 2021, T&uuml;rkiye was requesting an advanced payment of the excise tax (i.e.&nbsp; Special Consumption Tax -&lsquo;OTV&rsquo; and the VAT related to this tax) in order to approve strip stamps/banderol requests of companies. This had operational and financial impacts for companies since applying the strip stamps took quite a long time as it was done manually and that meant that companies had to predict sales months beforehand and pay the tax accordingly.</p>\n<p>On 15 June 2021, the TADAB published a new declaration on the Ministry&rsquo;s website. With this new declaration, although &ldquo;upfront tax payment&rdquo; in relation to banderol request was not requested anymore on paper, a number of constraints still applied in practice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The TADAB limits the number of strip stamps which can be ordered in one go to the equivalent of 1/12 of the planned annual sales activity, as indicated in the company&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alcoholic Beverage Distribution &amp; Authorization Certificate&rdquo;. &nbsp;</li>\n<li>The TADAB requests importers to pay the excise tax for a previous strip stamp order in order to accept a new order. Given the limitation on the number of strip stamps that can be ordered at once, this de-facto forces companies to pay excise taxes on the previous batch long before it has been sold.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Importers are required to provide guarantee equivalent to the amount of the OTV (and the VAT related to this tax) to be paid at the time of import for the number of products for which banderols were requested and granted by the TADAB.</li>\n<li>There is no time limit set in law with regard to TADAB&rsquo;s approval process or the time it takes for ordered strip stamps to be printed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Imported spirits bottles cannot be imported or leave the bonded warehouses until the company acquired the strip stamps in T&uuml;rkiye and applied them on spirit bottles.</p>\n<p>On 2 September 2021 the Revenue Administration published a new communiqu&eacute;. The communiqu&eacute; introduced, <em>inter alia</em>, the requirement of a guarantee in relation with the OTV and its related value added tax (&lsquo;VAT&rsquo;) payments for delivery of banderols for sale of alcoholic beverages.&nbsp;The guarantee letter was meant to replace the upfront payment of taxes. However, in practice, the guarantee letter is not used by importers as it is very difficult, if not impossible, to implement (cumbersome and very time-consuming).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In October 2022, the TADAB issued a new circular removing the limitation of banderol requests up to 1/12 of the annual &nbsp;sales activity&nbsp; if they had paid the SCT in advance or provided the guaranty.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The EU Industry confirmed that TADAB request to pay the excise tax for a previous strip stamp order in order to accept a new order was removed. However, the EU Industry also indicted that the option to use of a letter of guarantee is so lengthy and burdensome that most companies do not see it as a valid solution.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The EU Industry also&nbsp;indicated&nbsp;that Turkish customs authorities keep carrying out excessive sampling controls whereby, generally, at least 2 bottles are removed for analysis, on each depletion of stock from bonded warehouses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>T&uuml;rkiye has put in place an inspection regime and if companies apply for and submit to an authorisation check, the level of sampling can be reduced from 100% to 10%.</p>\n<p>Since the EU has stringent controls on safety standards for alcoholic beverages such sampling controls in T&uuml;rkiye are excessive within the&nbsp;Customs Union.&nbsp;</p>",

This limitation derives&nbsp;from the Article 7 of the Turkish Import Code (originally Article 7 of the Council of Ministers n&deg;1995/7606 published in December 1995, replaced by the Presidential Decree 3350 published on 31 December 2020). On the basis of this article 7, the Undersecretariat for Foreign Trade (UFT) (restructed as the Ministry of Trade since 2018) issues a new communiqu&eacute; every year as part of the Turkish Import Regime to list products which might imported&nbsp;with&nbsp;import licensing and under which conditions. Currently the Communiqu&eacute; contains only one annex (list)&nbsp; products that can be imported provided that certain conditions if stated such as type of product (for civil avaiation purpose or not), age/model, economic life, availability of domestic production and equivalent goods, CIF value are met and a license document is presented to the customs&nbsp;on release for free circulation. For instance, only certain retreated tyres for use on aircrafts could be imported with permission of the civil aviation authority and import license.</p>\n<p>For the <strong>background</strong>, the&nbsp; Communiqu&eacute; 2014/9, adopted in December 2013, included the three different import regimes&nbsp; and added 36 products to the list 1/A (fully liberalised products). 30 of these products were in the List 2 (goods liberalised only if above a minimum price) of the Communiqu&eacute; 2013/9. This was a positive development. However, the list of fully liberalised products in the Communiqu&eacute; 2014/9 did not include the products identified by the Commission's letter to the Turkish authorities of 14 March 2011. These products were only partially liberalised in 2012 (if above a minimum price). In addition, one of these products &ndash; the retreaded tyres &ndash; was not included in any of the liberalisation lists and the current import regime for these products is similar to de facto import ban. The reasons put forward by Turkey with regard to the import ban are based on environmental considerations (increase of waste accumulation because of their life cycle). However, retreaded tyres are type-approved under UNECE Regulations 108/109, and therefore legally accepted for commercialisation under same conditions (including guarantee) as new ones. Turkey is a signatory of those UNECE Regulations, and furthermore allows retreaded tyres on its market, but continues to ban the EU exports</p>",

Moreover, it provides for a set of quantitative thresholds for the procurement value below which foreign bidders may be excluded, but also competitive and transparent provisions do not apply, which therefore may be used as an additional tool for discriminatory treatment. Furthermore, since the enactment of the PPL in 2002, and in particular following the transition to the presidential system in 2018 granting ever increasing legislative powers to the Presidency and directorates and offices established by it, the number of exemptions and exceptions, derogating from the basic principles of public procurement rules, has considerably increased.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Turkey's 12th Development Plan (2024-2028) aims at protecting domestic production against the damages and threats caused by imports by taking the international obligations of the country into account. The plan prioritizes and commits to supporting localization in selected sectors (e.g., chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, machinery, electronics, electrical equipment, rail systems, automotive) and to expanding the scope of savings-oriented central public procurement policies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Article 63 of the PPL provides for four different forms of domestic preferences:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;- Foreign bidders may be excluded from procurement procedures below certain thresholds (financial thresholds are provided in Article 8 of the PPL).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;- <u>Price advantage</u> of maximum 15% (preference margin) may be granted in favour of <u>domestic bidders</u> in services and works procedures regardless of the value of contract.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;- <u>Price advantage</u> of maximum 15% may be granted in favour of <u>domestic goods</u> offered by bidders in <u>procurement of goods (supply)</u>. This may apply to both domestic and foreign bidders. There are also certain cases where the application of 15% price advantage for domestic goods becomes mandatory (medium and high technology products identified by the Ministry of Industry and Technology and for domestic software products).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;- Use of domestic products such as materials, equipment and machinery in construction works or all or a certain part of the software may be requested. Moreover, use of domestic medium low, medium high and high technology material, machinery and equipment to be listed by the relevant ministries is obligatory for the works procurements.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The first two types of preferences are related to the origin (seat) of an economic operator (bidder), the others concern origin of goods offered or used for the purposes of execution of public procurement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Turkey has also created a special mechanism in public procurement, so-called Industry Cooperation Programme similar to off-set practices, used in particular in the transportation, energy and health sectors. According to this mechanism, foreign companies awarded procurement contracts containing innovation, technology transfer and localisation are obliged to co-operate with Turkish companies in a joint production and investment activity and/or have to purchase from the Turkish companies in the domestic market. There is no legal limit determining a degree of such joint production/investment/import. The procuring public authority can determine such a percentage depending on the sector.</p>",

        "description": "<p>A country-wide ban of exports of live poultry is imposed by the United Arab Emirates on any EU Member State upon notification of an outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in birds, despite that strict EU control measures are imposed on the affected area in line with international standards.&nbsp; This harmonised EU policy of regionalisation is strictly implemented in the whole EU whenever an outbreak of HPAI occurs and it guarantees that trade can continue of safe poultry and products originating from the&nbsp;areas/products free of HPAI. Detailed information on the control measures (regionalisation) implemented in the EU is shared with trading partners immediately when outbreaks occur. Therefore, the EU considers that a country-wide ban is not in line with international rules (WTO SPS Agreement and OIE international standards) as it is considered more trade restrictive than necessary.</p>\n<p>However, the EU welcomes that the Competent Authorities of the&nbsp;United Arab Emirates&nbsp;recognise the regionalisation policy of the EU for HPAI&nbsp;with allowing&nbsp;imports of most poultry products (such as meat) to continue as&nbsp;the United Arab Emirates limit its&nbsp;trade restrictions to those areas affected with HPAI and which are put under control by the competent authority of the exporting country.</p>\n<p>The international standard of the OIE clearly states that a free status of the country, zone, compartment, can be regained three months after a stamping-out policy has applied.

        "title": "Procurement: Buy American",
        "country": "United States of America",
        "description": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Overview</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&ldquo;Buy American&rdquo; and &ldquo;Buy America&rdquo; (referred to collectively as &ldquo;Buy America(n)&rdquo;) are domestic content requirements for public procurement applied in the United States. Their purpose is to boost domestic production. The US adopted such requirements as early as 1933, during the Depression and has expanded them in the recent years.</p>\n<p>Despite these requirements, EU suppliers can&nbsp;access certain parts of the US procurement market, either because the US do not apply these requirements to some procurement covered by the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (\"GPA\"), or because it sometimes waives their application to other types of procurement (not covered by the GPA), or for the practical reason that an EU company has invested in production in the United States and supplies from its U.S. base.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The following fiche explains the conditions under which EU suppliers have access to the US procurement markets, the applicable rules, limitations,&nbsp;as well as the recent developments tightening the Buy America(n) conditions and their impact on the EU suppliers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;The US public procurement commitments towards the EU</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The GPA is the only instrument&nbsp;in which the United States has taken binding commitments regarding the access of EU operators, suppliers and services to the US procurement market. The US commitments cover federal entities (departments and agencies) and 37 out of the 50 US Federal States.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, these commitments are subject to certain <em>exceptions</em>. One of the most substantial exceptions allows the United States to apply Buy America(n) requirements in procurement linked to federal funding in specific areas such as aviation and mass transit and highway projects.&nbsp;Another substantial exception allows federal agencies to set-aside Federal procurement for US small- or minority-owned business. The US uses this flexibility, as its domestic law requires federal agencies to set aside for small US-based business all contracts above the &ldquo;US Simplified Acquisition Threshold&rdquo;. As of January 2018, this threshold was increased from US$150K to US$250K. Therefore, contracts under US$250K are now automatically set aside for small businesses and foreign companies, including EU companies, cannot bid for them unless they establish, pay taxes and employ staff in the US.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, the US has excluded from the scope of its GPA commitments some services sectors and therefore Buy American requirements can fully apply to them. This is the case, in particular, of \"dredging services\". This is to allow for the application of the \"Jones Act\" (see below), which reserves domestic maritime services to US-built, US-owned and US&ndash;crewed ships (even if the US occasionally grants individual waivers from the Jones Act requirements).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition, the US excluded from the scope of its GPA commitments some procurement by the Department of Defence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>2. The US Federal Government level procurement rules (including rules applicable to the State level)</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\"><strong>A. The Buy American and Buy America restrictions </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>The US has over time adopted a number of Buy America(n) restrictions, with the major ones being the following:</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the shipbuilding industry, the <strong>Jones Act<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\"><strong>[1]</strong></a></strong> (<strong>1920</strong>) requires goods shipped between U.S. ports to be transported on ships that are built, owned, and operated by United States citizens or permanent residents.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The <strong>1933&nbsp;Buy American Act,</strong>&nbsp;introduced during the Depression to boost domestic activity and create jobs, imposed US content requirements to federal procurement of goods (i.e. purchases by federal agencies and departments).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the defence area, the so called \"<strong>Berry Amendment</strong>\"<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a> (dating back to <strong>1941</strong>) established that the US Department of Defence can only procure US-products (including \"non-war\" material, such as textiles).</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<strong>1978</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Buy America Act</strong>&nbsp;introduces a group of local content requirements &nbsp;for infrastructure projects that receive federal funding by the US Department of Transportation (Federal Highway Administration, Federal Transit Administration, Federal Railroad Administration and Federal Aviation Administration) and some other federal entities&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"barrier/11190#_ftn3\">[3]</a></strong>. The act requires the use of domestically produced iron, steel and some other manufactured products in such projects, and was adopted as a complement to the Buy American Act (which did not cover most transit projects, including metros and highways) as they were carried out by States or other sub-federal entities). The 1978 Buy America Act creates one of the most important obstacles for access to US procurement.</p>\n<p>Buy-America-type of provisions have become a regular feature of bills for Federal funding to States, municipalities or transit authorities and have extended beyond transportation (see for example, regarding environmental projects, the 2014 <strong>Water Resources Reform and Development Act</strong>, which imposed local content requirements on projects funded by the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Water infrastructure fund).</p>\n<p><em>For interaction of these domestic rules with the US&rsquo; GPA commitments please see part 3.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\"><strong>B. The &ldquo;Made in America&rdquo; Executive Order<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\"><strong>[4]</strong></a> </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On 25 January 2021, President Biden signed the <strong>Executive Order</strong> <strong>on Ensuring the Future Is Made in All of America by All of America&rsquo;s Workers</strong> (the &ldquo;Made in America&rdquo; order). This order directed agencies to strengthen the application of existing Buy American requirements, including by limiting waivers. Moreover, it created the &ldquo;Made in America Office&rdquo; (the &ldquo;MIAO&rdquo;) as part of the Office of Management and Budget of the White House (the &ldquo;OMB&rdquo;), tasked to oversee the implementation of Buy America(n) policies and to increase transparency of the waiver processes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To implement the &ldquo;Made in America&rdquo; order, on 4 March 2022 the Federal Acquisition Council issued&nbsp;<strong>new rules updating and supplementing the 1933 Buy American Act</strong>, including:</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li><em>an increases of US content requirement for goods from 55%&nbsp; to 60% as of 25 October 2022, 65% as of 2024, and 75% as of 2029.</em></li>\n<li><em>a framework for price preferences for selected critical products, or products containing critical components (the list of products and price preferences still needs to be established)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\"><strong>C. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act&nbsp;<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\"><strong>[5]</strong></a> of 2021</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The&nbsp;<strong>US Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act</strong>&nbsp;(&ldquo;IIJA&rdquo;) was adopted on 15 November 2021 and authorised $1 trillion in spending on a broad range of infrastructure projects. As part of the IIJA, the US also adopted the &ldquo;<strong>Build America, Buy America Act</strong>&rdquo; (&ldquo;BABAA&rdquo;), which extended the application of local content requirements to all federally funded infrastructure projects (so-called &lsquo;flow down funding&rsquo;). As a result, infrastructure projects cannot benefit from federal funding unless all the steel, iron, construction materials &nbsp;and manufactured products used in the project are produced in the US.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These rules were recently further implemented by a revision of the <strong>OMB Guidance for Grants and Agreements part of the Federal Code of Regulation</strong><a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\">[6]</a> (the &ldquo;Guidance&rdquo;). In effect as of 23 October 2023, the Guidance serves to ensure consistent application of the Buy America preference across funding federal agencies and provides definitions and manufacturing standards for what is considered a construction material, i.e. non-ferrous metals, plastics, polymer-based products, glass, fibre optic cable, lumber, engineered wood and drywall.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition, the OMB has issued a revised <strong>Memorandum <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/M-24-02-Buy-America-Implementation-Guidance-Update.pdf\">M-24-02</a></strong> (the &ldquo;Memorandum&rdquo;) providing further information to federal agencies complementing the Guidance. It rescinds and replaces an earlier provisional guidance (<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/M-22-11.pdf\">M-22-11</a>), including on waivers for Buy America requirements. The revised Memorandum contains rules on (1) the application of Buy America requirements for infrastructure projects and (2) the process for waivers, providing important clarifications how the rules will be applied vis-&agrave;-vis US&rsquo; international commitments and foreign suppliers (<em>see part 3</em>).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Further information about the exemptions from these new requirements applied by the federal departments and agencies is accessible on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.madeinamerica.gov/financial-assistance/\">Made in America website</a>. &nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px; text-align: justify;\"><strong>C. US State level procurement </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The GPA commitments regarding the 37 US States covered &nbsp;apply to certain entities of the State Government, but not to cities. Furthermore, there US excluded some products in the case of some States (e.g. it excluded the procurement of vehicles by the States of Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, New York, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and &nbsp;Wyoming).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Besides, the States' legal framework in procurement is very fragmented, which causes&nbsp;<em>de facto</em>&nbsp;barriers. Each of the US States has their own laws and they impose new and additional Buy America(n) requirements giving favourable treatment to products which have been manufactured in the US. In particular, 27 States impose obligations within state-law to give favourable treatment to \"American made products\". Furthermore, some States impose obligations to favour US manufactured products when local entities use State-funds.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition, many States also impose preferences which give favourable treatment to products manufactured <strong>within a specific State</strong>. On top of State-law based preferences, additional requirements are applied for example by many US cities.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, many US States apply specific set-asides for US SMEs established within their respective State.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>3. Interaction between Buy America(n) requirements and the US international obligations, both at US Federal Level and at US State level </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To implement the commitments in the GPA and other trade agreements, the US adopted the Trade Agreements Act of 1979<a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\">[7]</a>. This Act authorised the President to introduce &ldquo;waivers&rdquo; regarding government procurement. For procurement at federal level covered by the US obligations under the GPA and other trade agreements (&ldquo;FTAs&rdquo;), the Office of US Trade Representative (&ldquo;USTR&rdquo;) has formally &ldquo;waived&rdquo; the&nbsp;<strong>Buy American</strong>&nbsp;<strong>requirements in a general manner</strong><a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\">[8]</a>. This means that, for the covered procurement at federal&nbsp;level, bids of eligible foreign products, which include those produced in the EU, should receive equal consideration with domestic products.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In contrast, the US has not waived&nbsp;<strong>Buy America</strong>&nbsp;<strong>requirements</strong> <strong>in a general manner</strong> for GPA covered procurement at State level.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Specific to the <strong>federally funded infrastructure projects and the recent Buy America requirements of the BABAA</strong>, the US explains extensively the interaction with international obligations and the use of waivers in Memorandum <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/M-24-02-Buy-America-Implementation-Guidance-Update.pdf\">M-24-02</a>. Among others, the Memorandum stipulates that &rdquo;[<em>i]f a recipient is a State that has assumed procurement obligations pursuant to the Government Procurement Agreement or any other trade agreement, a waiver of a Made in America condition to ensure compliance with such obligations <strong>may</strong> be in the public interest.</em>&rdquo; [emphasis added]. In addition, the Memorandum does not contain instructive language to State level entities to issue general applicability waivers for compliance with international obligations nor provides automaticity of the individual waivers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Apart from the case of procurement covered by the US GPA/FTAs obligations, <strong>Federal procurement regulations provide five other government-wide exceptions from the &ldquo;Buy American&rdquo; requirements</strong>:</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li><em>if a domestic end-product is not reasonably available in sufficient quantities of a satisfactory quality;</em></li>\n<li><em>if the cost of a domestic end-product would be unreasonable; &nbsp;</em></li>\n<li><em>if the purchase of a domestic end-product would be contrary to the public interest; &nbsp;</em></li>\n<li><em>in the case of purchase of commercial information technology; and</em></li>\n<li><em>in case of purchase for commissary resale.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>4. Lack of transparency</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The US does not have a single electronic portal for public procurement notices/summaries. In addition, in many States, to receive information on contracts and in order to bid, companies first have to register with the State. For this each State applies its own requirements. Some States require a payment to register as a bidder. Registration requirements act as further market access obstacles.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lack of easy access to information on procurement opportunities in the US States is a key deterrent to participate in US procurement.

The intended effect is to support US net-zero technology leadership by incentivising companies to move investments to the US and purchase US products. The broadness of the targeted technologies, and the uncapped and non-transparent nature of the subsidies provided means that the US is aiming to re-shore large parts of the value chains of key net-zero technologies, establishing itself as global technology leader and production hub at the cost of its largest trade and investment partners, including the EU.

        "description": "<p>President Trump signed on 22 December 2017&nbsp;a major revision of the US tax system with the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\" (TCJA). In addition to lowering the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, the TCJA substantially changed the manner in which the United States taxes international income. Proposed regulations implementing these changes were issued on 10 October 2018, 21 December 2018 and 6 March 2019.</p>\n<p>A specific fiscal incentive, the foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) tax deduction, bestows a fiscal incentive to exports. Specifically, a special tax deduction is linked to US exports of many goods and services, and the amount of the benefit depends on export performance. Given its design and effect, this tax deduction is a measure that would most likely qualify as a prohibited export subsidy under the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. It is estimated that this new export subsidy grants a significant financial benefit to US corporations.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the US introduced an additional corporate tax, called the base-erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT), which taxes royalties, intra-firm transfers, payments for machinery used in the US, insurance premiums, or payments in any way reducing the gross income of the US-based part of the firm.It is believed that this provision is not WTO-conform as it discriminates against imported goods or services. The inclusion of insurance premiums specifically targets European insurance companies.&nbsp;The latest US tax data released by the US government indicates that this additional tax is&nbsp;around $3.5 billion annually. Large insurance and financial companies&nbsp;might be incentivised to transfer assets into the US to reduce the BEAT, negatively affecting the efficiency of their operations. Smaller EU financial sector companies might even abandon the US market altogether.</p>\n<p>In addition, the US&nbsp;federal revenue code contains the Interest Charge Domestic International Sales Corporation (IC-DISC) rules, which were enacted by the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 and is a remnant from the Domestic International Sales Corporation (DISC) rules, which the EU successfully challenged in the GATT. They offer a tax benefit for exports of goods if done through a special-purpose corporation. The main tax benefit is that a portion of export income avoids corporate tax and is taxable to individual shareholders at the lower rates applicable to dividend income. It is estimated that this old export subsidy grants a significant financial benefit to US corporations.</p>",

        "title": "Maritime: Cabotage restrictions",
        "country": "United States of America",
        "description": "<p>The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 has been a&nbsp;fixture of U.S. law and an imposition on the U.S. economy for almost 100&nbsp;years. Better known as the &ldquo;Jones Act,&rdquo; the law was presented as a&nbsp;plan to ensure adequate domestic shipbuilding capacity and a&nbsp;ready supply of merchant mariners to be available in times of war or other national emergencies.<sup><a href=\"https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/jones-act-burden-america-can-no-longer-bear#_ednref1\">1</a>&nbsp;</sup>The law aims to achieve those objectives by restricting domestic shipping services to vessels that are U.S.-built, U.S.-owned, U.S.-flagged, and U.S.-staffed. These provisions extend beyond basic cabotage, for example, also restricting the provision of dredging services in a similar manner.</p>\n<p>As a&nbsp;result of these restrictions, the U.S. economy endures artificially inflated shipping costs because the transport of cargo between U.S. ports and within the country&rsquo;s vast inland waterways is off‐​limits to foreign competition and domestic shipping firms must pay vastly higher prices for the ships they use. &nbsp;It has proved particularly disastrous for Hawaii and Puerto Rico.&nbsp; However, it is claimed that the Jones Act creates and preserves jobs for Americans and therefore enjoys widespread and bipartisan support (even though the evidence supporting these claims is lacking), including from the Biden administration.&nbsp; The claim that the Jones Act is necessary to protect the national security is also widely accepted despite compelling evidence it has harmed the nation&rsquo;s security interests. Moreover, whilst the economic benefits of the Jones Act are concentrated, the costs are diffuse. This explains why the several attempts made over a century to render such rules less restrictive have all failed.</p>\n<p>While cabotage restrictions on maritime transportation between ports of the same country is common everywhere in the world (and to a certain extent also in the EU), what makes the US legislation peculiar and unduly restrictive, is the fact that domestic transportation - even when carried out by US operators - can only be performed using vessels which are US built, US owned/controlled, US crewed and US maintained. These requirements add to the effects of traditional cabotage measures important limitations in terms of shipbuilding (because no foreign built ship can be used), establishment (because only companies owned and controlled by Americans can carry out coastal trade services) and repair services (because vessels repaired/reconverted outside the US risk losing the necessary qualifications to operate again within US waters).</p>\n<p>The President has the authority to waive the Jones Act restrictions. Waivers &ldquo;from navigation and vessel inspection laws&rdquo;, allowing the recourse to non-US flagged vessels when there is no US-flagged capacity, are possible &ldquo;in the national &nbsp;interest&rdquo;, although limited in practise. However, this power has been used only sparingly and for short periods in the past, for example, for less than two weeks after Puerto Rico was hit by a devastating hurricane in 2017. Highly specialised waiver programs also exist (e.g. for the installation of jacket platforms (offshore platforms) ), but even these limited waivers come under attack by Jones Act proponents.&nbsp;<br /> <br />Congress included in the 2021 National Defence Authorization Act (NDAA) an amendment that clarifies that Jones Act restrictions extend all the way to the Outer Continental Shelf and apply to non-mineral energy resources, including offshore wind installations. Known as the &nbsp;&lsquo;Garamendi amendment&rsquo; (named for a Congressman who is a staunch supporter of the act), this provision will adversely affect offshore wind projects by substantially limiting the Executive&rsquo;s ability to grant Jones Act waivers for offshore energy projects that have been fairly routinely granted in the past. This understanding has been confirmed in a first ruling by the CBP (27 January 2021) related to this topic: <a href=\"https://rulings.cbp.gov/search?term=H309186&amp;collection=ALL&amp;sortBy=RELEVANCE&amp;pageSize=30&amp;page=1\">https://rulings.cbp.gov/search?term=H309186&amp;collection=ALL&amp;sortBy=RELEVANCE&amp;pageSize=30&amp;page=1</a>. Another amendment to the NDAA 2021 affects the waivers introduced at the request of the Secretary of Defense, by specifying that such waivers should be deemed &ldquo;<em>necessary in the interest of national defense to address an immediate adverse effect on military operations</em>&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;<em>only</em>&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>in the interest of national defense</em>&rdquo;. &nbsp;At least one expert has concluded that the vast majority of administrative waivers issued over the last 20 years would not have met this new standard. &nbsp;Finally, an additional amendment to the NDAA 2021 provides that the aggregate duration of &ldquo;waivers&rdquo; is limited to 45 days. It also appears that public reporting will be required on any foreign vessel using such a waiver to operate in US domestic comm<span style=\"color: #000000;\">erce.&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">European providers have found some success participating in wind farm installations, either by transiting products from ports in Canada or by working with US partners who move products from the US port to the off-shore installation site.&nbsp; In both cases, European installation companies have been utilizing US labour.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.westlaw.com/Document/I8333322169b111ebbea4f0dc9fb69570/View/FullText.html?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;VR=3.0&amp;RS=da3.0\">CBP Ruling HQ H309186</a>, the first one regarding offshore wind since the Garamendi Amendment's passing, came in late January 2021. The agency addressed the Jones Act's application under the new Amendment, specifically how it applied to the transportation of construction materials. CBP strictly interpreted the Amendment's language, finding that construction materials loaded in a U.S. port and destined for an offshore point in the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ) on a non-coastwise qualified vessel (even if the project was just beginning and there was no physical installation yet) would violate the Jones Act. The parties requesting the rulings, involved in the construction of the Vineyard Wind Project, wanted to use a Netherlands-flagged vessel or a foreign-flagged barge to transport and install scour materials. CBP concluded that the only way that this would be legal was if the scour material was loaded in a Canadian port and not a U.S. port. This ruling was a departure from CBP's previous stance.&nbsp; On Mar. 25, 2021, <a href=\"https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?cite=HQH317289&amp;VR=3.0&amp;RS=da3.0\">CBP issued HQ H317289</a>, which significantly modified its previous position. This clarification, more in line with prior CBP rulings, states that the pristine seabed does not fall under the Jones Act's scope, and establishes a new precedent for America's offshore wind development.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In February 2021, when Maersk Supply Services wanted permission to use a foreign jack-up vessel for the installation of materials, CPB ruled that such use was permissible so long as the vessel was used as a crane (remaining stationary) and did not transport people or materials between coastwise points. This is consistent with prior rulings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most recently, Congress introduced in February 2022 the &ldquo;American Offshore Workers Fairness Act&rdquo; (AOWFA) in both House (H.R. 6728) and Senate (S.3705). The bill proposes to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to require that all mariners on foreign-flagged vessels be either U.S. citizens, green card holders, or citizens of the nation of the flag state of the vessel. This workforce does not yet exist in the US, and will take years of apprenticeship to develop. European companies have pledged to support US offshore wind workforce development, and the US offshore industry has asked Congress to focus on such training, rather than on well-intentioned but detrimental restrictions. If implemented, AOWFA would make it very difficult (if not impossible) for specialized foreign-flagged offshore vessels to continue their operations in the US, potentially closing the domestic offshore market (wind as well as oil &amp; gas). This would ultimately cripple US offshore energy development &ndash; especially offshore wind &ndash; without yielding any security benefits or economic advantage to the US.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Note: The House adopted its bill on 29 March as part of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2022 (<a href=\"https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.congress.gov%2Fbill%2F117th-congress%2Fhouse-bill%2F6865%2Ftext%3Fq%3D%257B%2522search%2522%253A%255B%2522H.R.6865%2522%252C%2522H.R.6865%2522%255D%257D%26r%3D1%26s%3D1&amp;data=05%7C01%7CLovellJW%40state.gov%7C7bd386212a8d43a38c0608da55f2730e%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C637916797068355804%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=Fq3wd6m7HAHqIyT%2BsSWSEaCBsB3NgbBKJQ9jRs%2BtIpE%3D&amp;reserved=0\">H.R. 6865</a>) and the CGAA was itself adopted by House on 14 July 2022 as part of the National Defense Authorziation Act of 2023.

The new technical regulation introduced two new requirements that must be met by manufacturers wishing to register medicines in Uzbekistan: 1) positive results of clinical trials conducted in Uzbekistan and 2) on-site examinations of the manufacturing facility from Uzbek authorities to verify Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliance. While the new requirements apply also to Uzbek pharmaceutical companies, a waiver list of 21 countries was introduced including 12 EU Member States. As a result, the 15 EU MS not included in the waiver list are discriminated against those EU and non-EU MS that are listed given that Uzbekistan does not accept all EU exports complying with EU requirements or EU standards. The waiver list was modelled on the list of countries that were founding members of the ICH (International Committee for Harmonization), which defined drug registration standards. However, the list does not consider that also Member States that joined the EU from 2004 onwards (all excluded from the list apart from Hungary and Slovenia) adhere to the same high and strict regulatory standards as other EU Member States.</p>",

        "country": "Venezuela",
        "description": "<p>The pricing of goods and services in Venezuela, coming from foreign trade transactions or produced as result of foreign direct investments, is restricted by two laws which integrate a price control system that might constitute a technical barrier to international trade with Venezuela, and considering that the EU has no Free Trade Agreement with Venezuela.</p>\n<p>The<strong> <strong>Organic Law of Fair Prices</strong> (O.G. 40787 of 12/11/2015), </strong>establishes controls on pricing goods and services commercialised within the Venezuelan market, including imported ones, by the <strong>Superintendence for the Defense of Socioeconomic Rights (SUNDDE)</strong>, which fixes the selling prices, as well as of the all cost structures components. Also the law rules the limits to the profits of producers and importers.</p>\n<p>There is also the <strong>Constitutional Law on Agreed Prices</strong> (O.G (e) 6342 of 22/11/2017), which establishes an additional mechanism for determining the prices of goods and services that the Government considers prioritised. This mechanism is controlled by the Government and involves negotiations with the different competent entities of the public sector, as well as price inspections by the communal power bodies and the Productive Workers' Councils. The Government reserves the right to incorporate any good or service into this price control system.</p>\n<p>This legal framework establishes that every single person or company dedicated to the commercialisation of goods and services must be registered in the <strong>Unique Registry of Individuals and Companies that Develop Economic and Commercial Activities (RUPDAE)</strong>, which is mandatory for companies dedicated to the international trade.</p>\n<p>The prices are fixed in three categories: i) the <strong>Fair Sale Price (PVJ)</strong>, determined exclusively by the SUNDDE, ii) the <strong>Maximum Retail Price (PMVP)</strong>, which may be determined by the producer or importer with a margin of net profit no more than the 30% over the cost structure, or unilaterally fixed by the SUNDDE, and, iii) <strong>Agreed Prices</strong>, resulting from the negotiation between producers, importers and the Government. In all these modalities, the prices may be fixed at the discretion of the Government when special circumstances or the general and social interest prevail.</p>\n<p>The cost structures of these three pricing modalities must also be authorised by the Government. In the cases of the PVJ and the PMVP the updates will be made through the reference values of the <strong>System of Regular Price Adjustment (SACP). </strong>In terms of the Agreed Prices, through a methodology established by the Law in the <strong>Informatics System of Price Management</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>The market access is also controlled by SUNDDE</strong>. The possibility of incorporating products or services into the domestic market must be previously authorised by this agency, which will perform all the procedures for determining and fixing retail prices prior to marketing within the country.</p>\n<p>The price control system is supported by a regime of sanctions, which includes the occupation for 180 days, extendable, of the establishments and warehouses, the suspension from 3 to 10 years in the RUPDAE, the seizure of the goods, the revocation of permits and licenses, the application of fines and/or prison between 3 to 15 years for crimes of usury, speculation, fraudulent alteration, hoarding, boycott, destabilisation of the economy, resale of products, among others.</p>\n<p>The SUNDEE is attached to the <strong>Ministry of Internal Commerce</strong>, created in September, 2018 (O.G 41479). This ministry exercise the stewardship of the internal trade plans and the surveillance of the overall domestic commerce activities.</p>\n<p>The verification of the agreed price list of the 27 food items belonging to the basic basket continues in Venezuela. Likewise, the inspections in supplies, butchers, pharmacies, among other businesses continue, especially of the Maximum Price of Sale to the Public (PMVP), and the use of the Official Exchange Rate for users paying with foreign currency. Moreover, also inspections of schools and clinics continue.</p>\n<p>At the moment, there are no intentions to reform the law. However, the prices of EU products in Venezuela can be set without apparent intervention by the Venezuelan authorities for all products other than the 27 essentials, where the government establishes the cost structures. Thus, the application of the law is in a \"low profile mode\", but there are risks that it could be used at any time to limit the freedom to set prices. For now, SUNDEE does not use the legal tool coercively.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "title": "Foreign investment law",
        "country": "Venezuela",
        "description": "<p>On 29 December 2017,&nbsp;entered into force the <strong>Constitutional</strong> <strong>Law on Foreign Productive Investment</strong> (O.G. No. 41310), approved by the National Constituent Assembly (NCA), which revokes the Foreign Investment Law of 18 November 2014 (O.G (E) 6.152). The NCA was an entity not recognised by the EU then. The Law incorporates regulations that restrict the movement of foreign direct investment (FDI) to the Venezuelan economy. It concedes huge discretionary powers to the President to adopt measures that modify the mandates established in the Law, without the opinion of other public entities, regulators or arbitrators. The Law transfers the rules exercised by the National Centre for Foreign Trade (CENCOEX) to the <strong>Ministry for Foreign Trade and International Investment (MIPPCOEXIN)</strong>, and expands the surveillance functions over companies that invest with foreign capital, and for the establishment of FDI policies. The MIPPCOEXIN was eliminated in 2020 and became part of the portfolio of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The <strong>minimum investment is EUR 800 000, or RMB 6.5 million </strong>or its equivalent in another currency with a term of not less than two years. The repatriation of capital and profits is allowed &nbsp;2 years after the investment was made. It is also allowed to repatriate up to 100% of the profits obtained in a year and the total of the investment in case of liquidation of the company, once discounted the applicable taxes. The President may reduce these percentages of repatriation between 60% and 80% in special economic situations<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>The Law includes an <strong>investment contract</strong>, which must be signed by the foreign investor with its local public or private counterpart, including all the terms and conditions of the investment. This contract is part of the documents required for the Foreign Investment Registry that must be made before the authorities, regardless of the activity to which the investment is dedicated.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the 2014 law, it is not possible to keep part of the investment or assets abroad, since it is required that <strong>100 % the constituent value of the investment must be represented by assets present within the country</strong>. The assets invested will also be subject to surveillance. In addition, it is established the channelling of all monetary funds obtained from FDI through the national financial system. Consequently, <strong>the use of accounts abroad for the management of the investment is restricted</strong>, having to use only the national banks for this purpose. Likewise, the Law establishes a <strong>15% limit on the maximum amount of domestic financing</strong>. Investors with income of more than 70% from oil exports, or mining, must <strong>pay their taxes in foreign currency</strong>. Investors are allowed to carry out financial transactions, if they do not imply new capital investments. Any financial action must be notified to the authorities, otherwise it would be considered void.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Venezuelan State reserves for itself the development of strategic sectors according to the national interest</strong>. These sectors are not explicitly defined by law, which leaves a legal vacuum with respect to access and treatment criteria. In addition, for reasons of security and defence, the Government might decree especial investment regimes with the participation of foreign capital at different access levels than those established by law. The Law orders <strong>exhausting the national judicial means (courts) for the solution of controversies before resorting to any other mechanism</strong> offered by the integration systems of Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as within the framework of other integration schemes.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <strong>system of fines</strong> in case of breach of the investor obligations increases. The pecuniary sanctions are calculated based on a percentage of the total amount invested, payable in the currency in which the investment was made within a period of 15 days. The authorities may also consider the suspension of favourable conditions granted to the investment, such as accelerated depreciation, purchase of production by public entities, tariff and tax exemptions, special rates for public services, preferential access to inputs or raw materials administered by the State, and any other benefit provided by the Government. The registration of foreign investment might also be revoked.&nbsp;<strong>The Law prohibits the investor from participating in political activities</strong> or boycotts that could be considered as destabilizing and/or that threaten democracy and institutions, as well as in shaping opinions on topics of public interest in social media. The authorities must&nbsp; authorise the participation in social activities within the country or to collaborate in any way with any Venezuelan institution, whether public or private.</p>\n<p>In 2020, the authorities issued <strong>the Anti-Blockade Law</strong> as new economic policy tool to &ldquo;reverse the effects of foreign sanctions. The purpose of the law is to establish a special and temporary regulatory framework that provides the Venezuelan authorities with legal tools to counter, mitigate &nbsp;the impacts of unilateral coercive measures of any State or group of States, or by acts or omissions derived from them, by international organizations or other public or private entities outsiders. The provisions of this law are of public order and of general interest and will be applied at the national, state, and municipal levels.&nbsp; This law goes far beyond an Enabling Law, which grants exceptionally broad powers to the executive but creates a system that temporarily overrides constitutional, institutional and legal controls. It allows the government to sign contracts make decisions and manage assets without the limits of current legislation and, in addition, to do so in secret, while the law lasts. The mechanism takes discretion in public management to the extreme. Article 24 gives the Executive power to modify \"the constitution mechanisms\" of mixed companies in which PDVSA has a majority shareholding, in accordance with Article 303 of the Constitution, which establishes that the State will retain all of PDVSA's shares. An Observatory on unilateral coercive measures will created as an agency for the generation of relevant knowledge, and for the monitoring and evaluation of the implementation processes and their results. All public administration entities are obliged to supply the information required by the \"Observatory\" created, and the data handled \"confidentially&rdquo;. The income generated as a result of the application of the law will be oriented to i) developing compensation systems for wages; ii) finance the social protection system; iii) recover public services; iv) boost strategic industries and selective import substitution: v) support the implementation of the 16 productive economic engines of the Bolivarian Economic Agenda; and, vi) maintain public infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The authorities may proceed to the reorganization of decentralised entities for business purposes, inside and outside the country, to modernise and adapt them to the mechanisms of the commercial practices internationally. So, the mechanisms of constitution, ownership, management, administration, and operation of public or mixed companies, both in the national territory and abroad, can be modified without prejudice to the provisions of the Constitution. One of the most controversial aspects of the Anti-Blockade Law is linked to the confidentiality of decisions, de facto creating a transitional regime based on the classification of documents aimed at protecting and ensuring the effectiveness of the decisions taken by the Venezuelan authorities. All act and records are declared secret and reserved, up to 90 days after the cessation of the unilateral coercive measures and other restrictive or punitive measures that have led to the situation.</p>\n<p>The former NA declared \"ineffective\", the law and warned that any company or individual who makes agreements or negotiations under this instrument could be involved in crimes against the country, as being unconstitutional because it was not approved by it (art 202 NC).</p>\n<p>The instrument has been used among Russians and Chinese investors. In the oil sector, the state-owned PDVSA can modify the composition of joint ventures, so that a foreign partner can keep the majority shareholding.&nbsp; Up to 2024, no changes have ocurred to the FDI legal framework in Venezuela.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Anti-Blockade Law also created the<strong> International Centre for Productive Investment (CIIP)</strong> as a State institution with legal personality and its own assets, distinct and independent from the Republic, which enjoys the prerogatives and privileges granted by this Law. The CIIP is responsible for the registration, study and monitoring of Unilateral Coercive Measures and other restrictive or punitive measures; as well as the evaluation, approval and promotion of productive projects and the management of the Country Brand, as a strategy aimed at the promotion of investment and foreign trade. (Art 15. O.G No. 6.583.</p>\n<p>There has been no change in the law yet. Although a committee of the National Assembly is working on a project of draft reform, the ongoing rules continue been those issued by the defunct National Constituent Assembly, which was not recognised by the EU. It will be necessary to wait for a reform to be approved by the current Assembly before this barrier can be lifted.</p>",

        "title": "Foreign exchange control",
        "country": "Venezuela",
        "description": "<p><strong>The Venezuelan exchange rate regime has shifted significantly towards a more flexible one</strong>. After the country maintained an exchange control that adopted different schemes from 2003 to 2018, with all types of restrictions to foreign currency transactions and impacts on foreign trade and capital transactions, the current situation for the use of foreign currency has improved substantially. The legal basis for this flexibility is in the <strong>Exchange Agreement No. 1</strong> adopted between the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) and the Ministry of Economy and Finance, on 7 September 2018, (G.O. 6405 (e), which establishes a more flexible framework for foreign currency operations by introducing the \"free convertibility\" of the local currency (bolivar) and the ending of many existing exchange restrictions.</p>\n<p>According to the ongoing exchange rules, private sector individuals and companies are free to carry out foreign currency transactions without having to request the intermediation of the BCV, including foreign trade operations, labour and procurement contracts, digital payments. The possibility of entering into any transaction in foreign currency within the country is open.</p>\n<p>On 2 May 2019, Venezuela relaxed its exchange procedures by adopting the Central Bank Resolution 19-05-01 (O.G. 41.624), which authorised banking institutions to intermediate directly in the buying and selling of foreign currencies between individuals, companies and inter-banks transactions, and by using their own exchange tables. The system works with foreign and local accounts in foreign currencies maintained in the national and international financial places. The transactions of international organisations, diplomatic personnel and consular representations also can take place freely.</p>\n<p>The BCV may also carry out automatically sales operations of foreign currency to banks, when it deems appropriate, through unilateral debits in the accounts maintained by the respective banking institutions in the BCV, for the amount in bolivars equivalent to the exchange operation executed (Resolution 19-05-03; O.G.41.640, dated on 24 May 2019). The Central Bank interventions will be in accordance to the exchange rate policy, the reserve requirements ratios applied to banks (currently at 73% by Resolution 22-01-01) and the exchange intermediation indexes adopted on 15 May 2019 (Resolution 19-05-02; O.G. 41.633). The BCV carries out foreign exchange sales operations (foreign exchange interventions) to final customers through banks, which carry them out at their foreign exchange desks with the freedom to offer and agree on the operations, with transparency and traceability. Foreign currency accounts may be mobilised by customers not only for the different mechanisms that make up the Exchange Market System (EMS), but also with the products and services offered by the banking entities and/or through cash withdrawals in foreign currency.</p>\n<p>The BCV has a determining role in the exchange rate valuation, even considering that the BCV is not legally committed to offer any foreign currency to the new system. Since 2021, the central bank has been making regular interventions in the foreign exchange market as part of its anti-inflationary strategy. The BCV publishes on daily basis the weighted average exchange rate of the transactions traded at the bank exchange tables, which is official exchange rate of reference to the economy (Article 9 of Exchange Agreement No. 1).</p>\n<p>Banks must sell to their clients through their respective exchange tables at least 80% of the foreign currencies acquired, and the remaining 20% for inter-bank operations. The calculations for the fulfilment of the Index of Exchange Intermediation (IEI) to the final customer is on the last banking day of each week, based on the information corresponding to the daily flows. The BCV may modify the IEI when it deems appropriate. Banking institutions may also maintain a weekly average amount in liquid foreign currencies, equal to or less than 30% of the balance of the net availabilities in foreign currency held abroad by each banking institution as of 30 April 2019. The authorised exchange operators will not be able to process requests for the sale of foreign currency on behalf of their executives, shareholders, workers, attorneys, companies related, or affiliated. Financial institutions cannot buy foreign currency for themselves.</p>\n<p>Regarding retail sell transactions equal or less than &euro; 8,500 in cash and electronic transfers by operation continue through authorised exchange houses, as adopted on September 2018. The issuance and placement of securities denominated in foreign currency continue within the Caracas Stock Exchange.</p>\n<p>In 2022, the BCV ruled that foreign currency positions of banks in cash to retail transactions, may not be sold in their foreign exchange desks at a higher exchange rate than the rate established for the last foreign exchange intervention carried out by the BCV in the respective week when the banks received the cash.</p>\n<p><strong>In 2024, the Venezuelan authorities continue allowing massive digital payments using accounts with deposits in foreign currency.</strong> Since February 2021, the local banks were selling USD and EUR over the Internet for their clients who already have accounts in bolivars and in foreign currencies within the same entity. In 2024 this selling over the internet is not as fluid due to the international reserves constraints of the BCV. However transactions with USD and EUR electronically are available in daily basis for corporations. For now, just transfers are available among clients of a same bank, but the BCV and banks are preparing the basis for the clearing room among banks in foreign currencies for the future. <strong>The payments n stores through the debit cards, including international credit and debit cards in USD or EUR are allowed.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Banks cannot grant loans in foreign currency yet backed by their deposits in foreign currency</strong>, but in January 2022 were allowed to grant credits in bolivars backed by their foreign currency positions within certain limits, provided that the credits are expressed only through the use of the Credit Value Unit (UVC in Spanish). Besides, the Superintendence of Securities authorised since November 2020 the issuing of commercial papers in foreign currency on the Caracas Stock Exchange, with several primary placements of USD securities since then.</p>\n<p>At the present time, the total amount of money in USD in circulation is four times greater than the total liquidity in bolivars at the current exchange rate <strong>(Informal dollarisation)</strong>, which shows that foreign currency transactions are more important in terms of quantity and volume than local currency transactions. The larger amounts of foreign currency come from the BCV's supply through banks and from migrant remittances. Given that more than 60% of the country's transactions are already carried out in foreign currency, in March 2022, the authorities reformed the Law on the Tax on Large Financial Transactions (Igtf), to tax transactions in foreign currency and cryptocurrencies other than the official cryptocurrency Petro (G.O. Ext. No. 6.687) at initial rate of 3% at banks and shops.</p>\n<p>As of 9 October 2023, the scope of the cap on the exchange rate applicable by banks to the sale of foreign currency was extended until banks have sold all the intervention foreign currency provided by the BCV. Previously the cap only applied to the amount of intervention foreign exchange allocated in cash, and is now expanded to the total amount of intervention foreign exchange, which includes the cash foreign exchange allocated by the BCV and the foreign exchange that the BCV indicates to sell from the local use of international cards and the foreign exchange from the fraction of exports that must be sold by exporters to the BCV. The measure creates incentives for banks to sell intervention foreign currency quickly.</p>\n<p>Informal dollarisation of the economy is still very present. The exchange control situation is stable, as foreign exchange operations remain open, although restrictions on the mobility of funds persist, and foreign exchange accounts are restricted to manage cash deposits. Clearing between banks is not yet available.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "title": "Pharmaceuticals – registration of drugs and procurement rules",
        "country": "Vietnam",
        "description": "<p>On 12 November 2018 Viet Nam adopted Circular 32 that regulates the registration of drugs. The Circular entered into force on 1 September 2019. The stated objective&nbsp;was to ensure quality and traceability of pharmaceutical products imported to Viet Nam and the Circular was seen as a measure to reduce the presence of counterfeited drugs on the Vietnamese market. Several specific requirements, however, were excessive and not in line with international practice. The Circular 32 differentiated among Member States&rsquo; competent authorities, as in some Member States they were defined as &ldquo;Reference Regulatory Authorities&rdquo; (RRA) and in others as &ldquo;Stringent Regulatory Authorities&rdquo; (SRA). This differentiation implied simplified registration procedures for pharmaceutical products registered in one of RRA countries, for example it implies clear exemptions on phases of clinical trials for pharma registered by an RRA country. In addition in public procurement, there&nbsp;was a distinction of technical scoring between RRAs and SRA. This allows hospitals to give better scoring to medicines from the RRAs, eliminating drugs from the SRA countries.</p>\n<p>The Circular 15/2019/TT-BYT (&ldquo;Circular 15&rdquo;) on Bidding for Supply of Drugs for Public Health Facilities was officially issued on 11 July 2019. The Circular contained a distinction of technical scoring between the Reference Authorities countries (15 authorities) and Stringent Regulatory Authorities countries (&ldquo;SRA&rdquo;).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Viet Nam issued the new Circular 08/2022/TT-BYT of 5 September 2022, which ended the discrimination among EU regulatory authorities. Since 20 October 2022, date of its application, all EU MS producers have been treated at the same level.</p>\n<p>With regard to the validity of marketing authorizations, Circular 29/2020/TT-BYT of 31/12/2020 extended the validity of marketing authorisations, which expired during the period from 1/1/2018 until 31/12/2021. It also simplified certain aspects of the burdensome requirements of CPPs as introduced by Circular 32. It re-conduced GMP of the European Medicines Agency until 2021 and allowed for electronic certificates, both for CPPs and GMPs. According to EuroCham, approx. 464 medicines produced in the EU would have been affected given the fact that their marketing authorisations had already expired or would have normally expired by the end of June 2021.&nbsp;Resolution 12/2021 extended the validity of marketing authorizations until the end of 2022, but it continued to provide only a temporary solution to the marketing authorizations&rsquo; validity and&nbsp;was implemented in a fragmented manner.</p>\n<p>On&nbsp;8 February 2023 Viet Nam's Ministry of Health (MOH) published and enacted Decision 62/ QD-QLD on the &ldquo;<em>Announcement of the List of Medicines and Medicinal Materials with Market Authorisations Allowed to be Used under the Clause 1 Article 3 of the National Assembly Resolution 80/ 2023/ QH15 dated 9 January 2023</em>&rdquo;. 1856 imported medicines have&nbsp;been extended market authorisation validity until the end of 2024.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, this being a temporary solution, Viet Nam intends to offer a long- term, systemic solution through the amendment of its Pharma Law 2016 that would prolong the existing marketing authorisations beyond 31 December 2024. In the last Trade in Goods Committee in July 2024 Viet Nam announced that the review of the pharma law will resolve the problem of market authorizations that should remain valid beyond end of 2024. EUDEL understands that the draft amended pharma law has been presented to the National Assembly but it still to be confirmed.</p>\n<p>A preliminary check indicates this draft contains improvements compared to the current legislation with simplified procedures for the renewal of marketing authorisations (there would be no gap from 31 December 2024), a shortened review timeline for imported products, and more rights given to FIEs in the pharma sector. Other issues remain vague given the fact that the implementation will depend on guiding decree (to be enacted by Prime Minister) and Circular (by Minister of Health).</p>",

There are also recently reported cases of infringement of protection concerning wine GIs from Spain (e.g. Rioja, Ribera del Duero) reported by Spanish Authorities and no action was taken, &nbsp;and France (e.g. Bordeaux) for which GI rightholders contacted Vietnamese authorities on and are expecting administrative action.&nbsp;These cases were specifically discussed at the 4<sup>th</sup> Working group on IPR.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As regards Bordeaux, in spite of the good cooperation with FR Authorities on effective enforcement, EU DEL was informed by operators that they need to register with VN Customs Authorities to benefit from &ldquo;enhanced surveillance&rdquo; at border. However it seems that such registration is not simple notably if the operator is not the &ldquo;right holder&rdquo; indicated in the EU single document (For example, CIVB, a legitimate user, tried to register &ldquo;Bordeaux&rdquo; with customs but as in the EU official document, the contact point is INAO it makes that registration difficult. Such registration with Custom Authorities is not foreseen in the FTA.<br /> Viet Nam revised its IP legislation in 2022, including on GIs, to align domestic legislation with related provisions in the EVFTA. New provisions were inserted on homonymous GIs following Article 12.27.3 of the EVFTA, as well as on GI ownership and the need for every GI user to be registered with the IP Office.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
