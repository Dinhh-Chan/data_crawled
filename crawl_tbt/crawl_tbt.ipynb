This means that the shipping line has to wait for payment and containers remain blocked for other use in shipping.<br />- It sets restrictions in the repatriation of freights by the shipping lines. Any income from freight due to the shipping lines and received by the line&rsquo;s agent from importers later than 90 days after arrival of the vessel may not be transferred outside Algeria.<br />- Algeria does not allow operators which share vessels in order to ensure more frequent calls and higher quality to open disbursement accounts (system of slot chartering).<br />- very cumbersome and time consuming control system of customs for the final disbursement account are in place, thus costly for all concerned and delaying legitimate transfers.</p>\\n<p>At the end of 2015, as a result of pressure from the EU, rules were changed for the future (notably by allowing operators to open supplementary disbrusement accounts for payments received beyond the 90 day-deadline).
